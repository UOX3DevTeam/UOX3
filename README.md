# How to compile UOX3...
## Step 1: Set up a Build Environment
*First, set up a proper build environment with the various tools needed to clone and compile UOX3.*
<details>
  <summary>Install <strong>build tools</strong></summary>

  > * **Windows** - Download and install [Community Edition of Visual Studio 2017 or 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
  > * * Be sure to also install **Desktop development with C++** via the Visual Studio Installer, along with the individual component titled **VC++ 2017 version 15.9 v14.16 latest v141 tools** (VS2017) or **MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools** (VS2022). CMake is included for command-line builds.
  > * **Linux (Debian-based)** - Run `sudo apt install build-essential cmake` in a Terminal:  (or use your Linux distro's package manager)
  > * **FreeBSD** - Run `pkg install cmake` in a Terminal. Alternatively, build `cmake` via ports if desired.
  > * **macOS** - Download [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (for building with an IDE) via the App Store, and/or [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (for command-line builds)
  > * **Docker/Podman** - Ensure that it is downloaded and installed (Windows) or installed from your package manager
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Install <strong>Git</strong></summary>

  > * **Windows/macOS** - Grab [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or your preferred git tool
  > * **Linux** - Run `sudo apt install git` in a Terminal.
  > * **FreeBSD** - Run `pkg install git` in a Terminal. Alternatively, build `git` via ports if desired.
</details>

---

## Step 2: Clone the UOX3 Git Repository
*Next up, clone the UOX3 git repository, which also includes the latest verified compatible version of SpiderMonkey (v1.7.0) and a minimal set of files required to compile zlib-1.2.11.*
<details>
  <summary>Using <strong>GitHub Desktop</strong> (Windows/macOS)</summary>

  > 1. Run GitHub Desktop and click **File->Clone Repository** from the menu.
  > 2. Enter **https://github.com/UOX3DevTeam/UOX3.git** in the URL tab, and provide a local path for storing the cloned repo on your drive.
  > 3. Hit the **Clone** button to clone the stable master branch of UOX3 to the specified local path
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Using <strong>Command Line git</strong></summary>

  > 1. Run `git clone https://github.com/UOX3DevTeam/UOX3.git` in a Terminal to clone the stable master branch of UOX3 into a subdirectory of the current directory you're in.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>(Optional) Checking out Other Branches</summary>

  > If you'd rather grab another branch of the git repository, like the **develop** branch where most updates get pushed first before being merged into the master branch, you can use the following command *after* completing the previous step:
    `git checkout develop`

  > GitHub Desktop users can change the active branch via the *Current Branch* dropdown menu in GitHub Desktop.

</details>

---

## Step 3: Compile UOX3
*Finally, compile UOX3 using the build environment you set up in Step 1.*
<details>
  <summary><strong>Visual Studio 2022</strong> (Windows), <strong>automake.sh</strong> (Linux/FreeBSD), <strong>XCode</strong> (macOS)</summary>

  > * **Visual Studio 2022** - (Windows) Open *UOX3\make\VS2022\uox3.sln* (VS2022), choose *Release/Debug* from dropdown menu, and hit *Build -> Build UOX3*
  > * **automake.sh** - (Linux/FreeBSD) Run `./automake.sh` in a Terminal, from the root of the cloned UOX3 repository. This compiles UOX3 with CMake, but in one command only. Use optional argument `-b debug` to create debug build, and/or `-o clean` to do a clean build
  > * **XCode** - (macOS) Open *UOX3/make/XCode/uox3/uox3.xcworkspace*, select *Build*
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>CMake</strong> (Any platform, manual instructions)</summary>

  > If you don't wish to rely on the automake.sh script, but want control over the process yourself, follow these steps (same as what automake.sh does) in a Terminal. This also works on Windows/macOS as an alternative to compiling with IDEs:
  > - Navigate to root of cloned UOX3 git repository, and execute these commands:\
  > `cd make/cmake`\
  > `mkdir build`\
  > `cd build`\
  > `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` (Windows/Linux/FreeBSD)\
  > `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G"Unix Makefiles"` (macOS)\
  > `cmake --build . --config Release`\

  > Replace "Release" with "Debug" in the above instructions to create a debug-build; delete **make/cmake/build** directory to do clean builds.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>GCC/make/gmake</strong> (Linux/FreeBSD, manual instructions)</summary>

  > If you'd rather use GCC (v9.x or higher)/make (GNU Make 4.2.1 or higher) than CMake, you can follow these manual steps. Note that for FreeBSD, this approach requires installing **gmake** as an alternative to *make*: `pkg install gmake`

  > First, navigate to **spidermonkey** directory and run these commands:\
  > `make -f Makefile.ref DEFINES=-DHAVE_VA_LIST_AS_ARRAY CC=gcc` (Linux)\
  > `ar -r libjs32.a Linux_All_DBG.OBJ/*.o` (Linux)\
  > `cp Linux_All_DBG.OBJ/jsautocfg.h ./` (Linux)\
  > `gmake -f Makefile.ref DEFINES=-DHAVE_VA_LIST_AS_ARRAY CC=clang` (FreeBSD)\
  > `ar rcs libjs32.a FreeBSD_DBG.OBJ/*.o` (FreeBSD)\
  > `cp FreeBSD_DBG.OBJ/jsautocfg.h ./` (FreeBSD)

  > Next, head to the **zlib** directory:\
  > `cd ../zlib`\
  > `make distclean`\
  > `./configure`\
  > `make`

  > Finally, head to **UOX3/source** directory:\
  > `cd ../source`\
  > `make` (Linux)\
  > `gmake` (FreeBSD)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Visual Studio 2017</strong> (Windows)</summary>

  > When using VS2017, static libraries of the dependency projects (SpiderMonkey and zlib) need to be compiled prior to the UOX3 project. However, after those sub-projects have been compiled once, they never need to be compiled again, and from that point on only the build instructions for UOX3 itself applies:

  > #### SpiderMonkey ####
  > 1) Navigate to the **UOX3\spidermonkey\make\VS2017\jscript\** folder and open **jscript.sln** in VS2017.
  > 2) Make sure you have **jscript** selected in the Solution Explorer, then select **Release** and **x64** (64-bit) in the Solution Configuration/Platform dropdown menus
  > 3) Click **Build > Build jscript** from the menu.
  > 4) Visual Studio will compile SpiderMonkey and create a **spidermonkey\make\VS2017\jscript\x64\Release\** (64-bit) folder with the compiled **jscript.lib** library file contained within. No further actions are necessary here, so you can close the SpiderMonkey VS Solution.

  > ### zlib ###
  > 1) Navigate to the **UOX3\zlib\make\VS2017** folder and open **zlib.sln** in VS2017.
  > 2) Select **Release** and **x64** (64-bit) in the Solution Configuration/Platform dropdown menus
  > 3) Click **Build > Build zlib-static** from the menu.
  > 4) Visual Studio will compile zlib and create a **zlib\x64\Release** (64-bit) folder with the compiled **zlib-static.lib** library file contained within. No further actions are necessary here, so you can close the zlib VS Solution.

  > #### UOX3 ####
  > 1) Navigate to the **UOX3\make\VS2017\** folder and open **uox3.sln** in VS2017.
  > 2) Make sure you have **UOX3** selected in the Solution Explorer, then select **Release** and **x64** (64-bit) in the *Solution Configuration/Platform dropdown menus*, or via **Build -> Configuration Manager**.
  > 3) Select **Build -> Build UOX3** to start compiling UOX3. When done, you'll find **UOX3.exe** in **UOX3\make\VS2017\Release\x64**.

  > From here on, if you wish to re-compile UOX3, just open the uox3.sln and hit rebuild.
  > Note that if you wish to change from Release to Debug build, the sub-projects (SpiderMonkey and zlib) also need to be compiled for Debug mode prior to compiling UOX3.

<details>
  <summary>(Troubleshooting) Adding SpiderMonkey/zlib references in Configuration Manager</summary>

  > If VS give you link errors when attempting to build UOX3, references to SpiderMonkey or zlib might have gone missing! Try the following steps to add them back.

  > 1) Right click on **UOX3_Official** in the Solution Explorer, and select Properties.
  > 2) With the desired configuration (ex: Release, x64) selected at the top of the panel, add references to SpiderMonkey and zlib in these sections:
  > * *VC++ Directories >* **Include Directories** (add path to SpiderMonkey and zlib root folders)
  > * *VC++ Directories >* **Library Directories** (add path to **spidermonkey\make\VS2017\jscript\x64\Release** folder, as well as **zlib\make\VS2017\x64\Release** folder)
  > * *VC++ Directories >* **Source Directories** (add path to SpiderMonkey and zlib root folders)
  > * *Linker >* **Additional Library Dependencies** (add path to **spidermonkey\make\VS2017\jscript\x64\Release** folder, as well as **zlib\make\VS2017\x64\Release** folder)
  > Press apply!
  > Repeat process for both Release and Debug configurations (chosen at top of panel), then retry the UOX3 build process!

</details>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Docker/Podman</strong></summary>

  Build and tag the image from the root of the repository like: `docker buildx build --progress=plain -t uox3 .` or `podman build -t uox3 .`
</details>

## UOX3 Compiled! Now what?
Once done compiling, you can copy the compiled UOX3 binary/executable to the directory you intend to run your UOX3 shard from, along with all the files and folders contained in the UOX3/data subdirectory. Where you'll find the compiled UOX3 binary/executable depends on your platform and build method. Examples:
  * **Windows** - (VS2022) Compiled UOX3.exe can be found in **UOX3/make/VS2022/x64/Release**
  * **Linux/FreeBSD** - (automake.sh) Compiled uox3 binary can be found in **root UOX3 repository**
  * **macOS** - (XCode) Compiled uox3 binary can be found in **UOX3\make\XCode\Build\Products\Release**
  * **Either Platform** - (CMake, manual) Compiled uox3 binary can be found in **UOX3\make\cmake\build**

**It is recommended** to run your UOX3 shard from a separate, dedicated directory instead of the data directory in your local UOX3 git repository, to avoid potential git conflicts and accidental overwrites when pulling updates to UOX3 from GitHub in the future.

Once you have all the required files in place, you can follow the regular steps listed under **Installation and Setup > Configuring Your UOX3 Shard** in the UOX3 documentation (see docs folder, or visit https://www.uox3.org/docs/index.html#configureUOX3) to finish your UOX3 setup.
