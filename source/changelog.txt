09/1-20/2023 - It begins (based of "Official" UOX3 RC6)
    Lowercased all files
    removed global headers, included what was needed
    redid accounts and resource loading methods
    made console a singleton
    replace cserverdata with serverconfig, made singleton, and entry processing
    reformated
    replaced global pointers with globals.  Identified dependencies.  moved to global.cpp (to later to be put in the correct places, this is phase 1).
    separated network low level to use utilitlies NetSocket.  remove all platfrom/network specific code from UOX proper.  Consolidated network type things (ip forwarding, ip blocking, server socket), NetworkMgr.  Now in a position to start looking at network changes, etc.
    as a result of network changes, an allow list is now supported. Should deny/allow list file names be in config file?
