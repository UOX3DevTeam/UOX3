				makemenu,	// makemenu entry for crafting something from ingot
				oreChance,	// default global chance of finding this ore type
				scriptID 	// script attached to mined ore
			],
			orePrefChance 	// Chance of finding this ore type in given town region
		.GetOreChance() 	// Get base chance of finding any ore in town region
	Moved Mining skill plus gravedigging feature from hard code to scripts (js/skill/mining.js) to make it easier to maintain and/or customize, and removed hard coded variants

17/03/2023 - Xuri
	Fixed an issue where casting Wall of Stone inside a multi would lead to the wall of stone never expiring, because it was not correctly marked as a field spell
	Reduced combat message spam; attacking messages now only appear when attacking targets who are not already fighting the attacker
	Added a new character state - "passive combat mode" - primarily used by players when they tab out of combat. Tabbing out of combat will prevent the character from retaliating in combat if they're already fighting someone
	Fixed several issues with dropping items through floors, tables and generally not being placed correctly when dropped inside multis
	Hard-defined the Z-level at which some jewellers in Britain spawn to deny them rooftop access (spawn_felucca_town_britain.dfn and spawn_trammel_town_britain.dfn)

	Updated Item DFNs with ORIGIN and SECTIONID tags for relevant items
	Added JS Function to make comparing eras (based on object origin or server settings) easier:
		EraStringToNum( eraString )	// Takes an era string (uo, t2a, uor, td, lbr, aos, etc) and returns an int
	Updated some JS scripts to use EraStringToNum() for era comparisons (potionkeg.js)
	Default CORESHARDERA setting is now LBR
	Removed PUB15 as a separate "era" - it's identical to late stage LBR anyway:
		Removed support for GETPUB15 tag
	Added support for GETUO tag for items/NPCs:
		GETUO=<sectionID>		// Inherit DFN section if core shard era is Ultima Online (original release, before T2A)
	Rewrote portions of MsgBoardQuestEscortCreate() function in msgboard.cpp to ensure only escort regions within same world as NPC can be selected as destinations
	Increased maximum number of possible escort regions that can exist from 255 to 65535
	Added region definitions for all shrines in Britannia (Fel & Trammel), and marked them as valid destinations for NPC escorts (uox3/regions/regions.dfn)
	Moved bankers from vendor to human DFN files, and made them inherit basehuman instead of basevendor - since they are not vendors
	To address an issue with escorted NPCs not timing out and vanishing if they are left in a "dormant" area of the world with no player activity, the NPCs are marked as "always awake" the moment they arrive at their destination. Note that the uox.ini setting ALLOWAWAKENPCS needs to be enabled for this to work.
	Fixed an issue where spawnsection of spawners did not show up correctly in tweak menu
	Fixed an issue where the generic Orc AI script didn't have a return true at end of onDamage() event, which prevented all orcs from taking damage in combat (js/npc/ai/monster/orc.js)

	Exposed the following character properties to JS engine, which can be used to view/adjust the permanent hair/beard options for a character:
		.hairStyle
		.hairColour
		.beardStyle
		.beardColour
	Updated 'kill hair, 'shavehair, 'shavebeard and 'remove commands to clear permanent hair/beard colour and style properties in addition to removing the item itself
	Added a GM override to let GMs place as many houses as they want (js/server/house/houseDeed.js)
	Fixed an issue where attempting to sell items to NPC shopkeepers could result in client crashing
	Added a new JS Event:
		onMultiLogout( iMulti, cPlayer ) 	// Handles players logging out while inside multis
	Updated house script (js/server/house/house.js) with onMultiLogout event, which allows owners (always) and co-owners/friends/guests (if option enabled in uox.ini) to safely log out inside the house (without getting booted).
	Added a "keyless" option for interacting with locked doors (js/item/doors.js) of player-owned houses, which lets owners/co-owners/friends/guests of a house use locked doors in the house without requiring a key in their backpack, if the options for that are enabled in UOX.INI. Enabled for owners/co-owners and friends by default (but not for guests)
		Note that if option to safely log out is enabled, but keyless option is NOT enabled, then the server will check if the player has a key to the house in their backpack, and eject them from the house upon logging out if not. This is to make sure players don't get stuck inside a house they can't get out of because they lack the rights to open doors etc.
	Added new UOX.INI options, under the [houses] section:
		SAFECOOWNERLOGOUT=1 	// Allow co-owners to safely and instantly log out inside house
		SAFEFRIENDLOGOUT=1 		// Allow friends to safely and instantly log out inside house
		SAFEGUESTLOGOUT=1 		// Allow guests to safely and instantly log out inside house
		KEYLESSOWNERACCESS=1 	// Allow owner of house to use locked doors in house without key in pack
		KEYLESSCOOWNERACCESS=1 	// Allow co-owners of house to use locked doors in house without key in pack
		KEYLESSFRIENDACCESS=1 	// Allow friends of house to use locked doors in house without key in pack
		KEYLESSGUESTACCESS=0 	// Allow guests of house to use locked doors in house without key in pack
	Fixed NOHAIR tag from races.dfn not being loaded correctly

	Fixed an issue with IsInBuilding JS Function which could only handled a limited subset of instance ID values
	Corrected name of tag used to attach scripts to ore types - from SCRIPTID to SCRIPT

	Added a timer-related script that can be used to keep track of long-term timers (up to 49 days) on objects, and which will remove itself from the object when there are no more active timers left. Currently used to keep track of tribal paint applied to players:
		js/server/timer/long_term_timers.js (3)
	Fixed an issue where player backpacks did not have a max weight set, which could cause issues for scripts that relied on checking max weight of backpack to work
	Added new UOX.INI settings to let shard admins control the maximum weight that player backpacks and bankboxes can hold:

	Fixed an issue where a player meeting the exact minimum requirements for crafting an item would always fail
	Fixed a bug with teleporting off boats to valid nearby locations when double-clicking boat planks while standing on it
	Updated behaviour of planks on boats:
		Boat key can unlock plank, but won't automatically open it
		Boat key used on an open, unlocked plank will lock and automatically close the plank
		Boat key used on an open, locked plank will unlock the plank and leave it open
		Player using an unlocked plank now opens it
		Player using an open plank will disembark (if onboard) or embark (if not) the boat

	Fixed a bug where certain JS Functions, Methods and Properties would occasionally pass incorrect values to scripts that called upon them. Scripts that rely on the GetCurrentClock() Function, the .GetTimer() Method, .decayTime, .logTime, .oreTime and .fishTime Properties might need to be updated to account for the fix, which causes larger values to be passed in than before.
	Fixed a bug related to GetCurrentClock() that caused decay and respawning of dungeon chests from working properly
	Fixed a bug related to GetCurrentClock() and .logTime/.fishTime that prevented consumption and regeneration of log/fish resources from working properly

	Added new JS Methods for Characters and Items, for getting/setting expiry time for a specific timer belonging to a specific script attached to an object, or to kill said timer completely:
		.GetJSTimer( timerID, scriptID )
		.SetJSTimer( timerID, timeInMilliseconds, scriptID )
		.KillJSTimer( timerID, scriptID )
	Added new JS commands:
		'getjstimer timerID,scriptID 	// Spits out remaining time before timer expires

05/07/2022 - Xuri (0.99.5b-3)
	Fixed an issue where multis could vanish because multi data was not always correctly saved out to house.wsc; now multi data is saved to the same wsc files as other items instead. UOX3 still reads house.wsc content on world load, but will delete the file on the first world save, as it's no longer needed.

05/07/2022 - punt
	Fix for invalid uo directory causing crash
	Address an error in the using the error prone generic list (push/pop). Had an additional push, without a corresponding pop

05/07/2022 - Xuri

	Adjusted scissors script (js/skill/tailoring/scissors.js) to stop preventing use of scissors while the system thinks the player is running, but just show the associated message without any other impact

08/05/2022 - Xuri
	Fixed an issue where non-mounted NPCs didn't get proper default values set for mounted walking, running and fleeing speeds

03/04/2022 - Xuri
	Fixed a bug with skill check code that resulted in much lower than expected success rate at using skills (non-crafting ones in particular)
	Updated code for how the minimum 50% success-rate is calculated for crafters who meet all minimum skill requirements for crafting an item, which previously incorrectly gave crafters a much higher chance of success!
	Tweaked how rank is calculated for crafted items to modify the final rank based on base chance of success at crafting item. This brings the chance of crafting exceptional (10/10 rank) items more in line with how difficult this was in LBR era on official shards
	Adjusted how estimated chance for crafting exceptional items is calculated in crafting script (js/skill/craft/itemdetailgump.js) to be more in line with what actually takes place in code

22/03/2022 - Xuri
	Reverted from using strncpy_s to strncpy due to some unforeseen side effects that could cause script errors and crashes. Additional work might be required in order to safely convert to strncpy_s
	Updated 'radd command to provide better feedback when using incorrect syntax. Also added redirects to 'radditem and 'raddnpc commands when "item" or "npc" is detected as a parameter of this command

07/03/2022 - punt

	Various source changes made to address warnings
	Updated project files and filters to be more consistent between VS2017 and VS2022 solutions (Xuri)

02/03/2022 - Xuri (0.99.5b-2)
	Added a new feature that allows shard admins/scripters to mark specific NPCs as "permanently awake", in order to keep UOX3 running scripts, timers and updates for these NPCs even if they are in regions that are "asleep" because of no nearby online players.
		A new UOX.INI setting has been added which can turn this feature on/off:
			ALLOWAWAKENPCS=0/1 	// If disabled, NPCs marked as awake are treated as regular NPCs
		New NPC DFN tag added to mark an NPC as awake or not:
			AWAKE=0/1 		// 0 = disabled (default), 1 = enabled
		New Character JS Property added to toggle an NPC's awake state via JS:
			.isAwake 		// 0 = disabled (default), 1 = enabled
		'get and 'set commands updated with the new awake property:
			'get awake
			'set awake 0/1
	IP of shard in shard list is now sent to client in little endian instead of big endian, which should correct the ping displayed in shard list, which previously showed a timeout (punt)

28/02/2022 - Xuri
	Updated UOX.INI setting NETWORKLOG to actually control logging of network traffic for all connected clients, without needing each socket to have logging enabled via the manual console command 'Z'. This console command can still be used, however, to override a disabled INI setting and enable network traffic logging for connected clients.
	Updated 'get and 'set commands to support getting/setting a range of socket properties for a targeted (online) player:
		tempInt 			// int (temporary value)
		tempInt2 			// int (temporary value)
		xText 				// string (temporary string)
		clickX 				// int (x coordinate of where player clicked with targeting cursor)
		clickY 				// int (y coordinate of where player clicked with targeting cursor)
		clickZ 				// int (z coordinate of where player clicked with targeting cursor)
		walkSequence 		// int (movement sequence number, between 0 and 255)
		currentSpellType 	// int (current spell being cast by a player)
		logging 			// bool (enable to override disabled NETWORKLOG setting)
		pickupX 			// int (x coordinate of where player picked up an item from)
		pickupY 			// int (y coordinate of where player picked up an item from)
		pickupZ 			// int (z coordinate of where player picked up an item from)
		pickupSpot 			// int (0 = nowhere, 1 = ground, 2 = ownpack, 3 = otherpack, 4 = paperdoll, 5 = bank)
		language 			// string (language code)
	Fixed an issue where CUSTOMINTTAG in NPC DFNs would not get read properly, but would instead print an (incorrect) warning about how the tag was formatted

27/02/2022 - Xuri
	Fixed a server crash related to attempting to play music for non-existent sockets

26/02/2022 - Xuri
	Fixed a server crash caused by a couple of items in "stone walls 4" section of add-menu that were missing their ID in ItemMenu.bulk.dfn (thanks, Humility)
	Fixed an issue where items added to house (multi) definition would not be attached to the house if their coordinates were not within the boundaries of the house. This prevented the usage of house foundation multis with custom stairs, for instance.

26/02/2022 - Dragon Slayer
	Added JS-based help menu accessible via character paperdoll, with modernized style and UI, ability for players to change their password
	Minor cleanup and addition of a few extra features to help menu, like a safe teleport option for players who are potentially stuck, updated server info details and integration with UOX3's existing GM paging system as support options (Xuri)
	Added new JS functions to retrieve server data used for server stats in help menu:
		GetItemCount()				// Gets number of items on server
		GetMultiCount() 			// Gets number of multis on server
		GetCharacterCount()			// Gets number of characters on server
		GetServerVersionString() 	// Gets server version as a string
	Added new UOX.INI settings to control safe teleport for stuck players via the Help menu in Paperdoll:
		MAXSAFETELEPORTSPERDAY=1 		// Max teleports per day, defaults to 1
		TELEPORTNEARESTSAFELOC=1 		// Teleport player to nearest safe location (1) or random safe location (0)
	Added 'res as an alias of 'resurrect command
	Added alias names for items in misc_magic.dfn, potions.dfn, reagents.dfn and scrolls.dfn, to allow adding these items using 'add item bloodmoss, or 'add item lesserexplosionpotion

26/02/2022 - punt
	Added some error checking for sockets

25/02/2022 - punt
	Timing instrumentation added to allow obtaining information to aid in analyzing performance issues

25/02/2022 - Xuri (0.99.5b-1)
	Fixed an issue with monster speech script that prevented orcs, lizardmen, ratmen and wisps from taking damage in combat
	Fixed an issue where the body ID for Shadow Lords (0x2c0) was missing the 0x prefix in its Creature DFN entry, causing UOX3 to overwrite the data (primarily sounds) for the Ettin (0x2) entry
	Fixed an issue where the [longpants] definition (dfndata/items/gear/clothes/clothes.dfn) did use the get= tag correctly (Dragon Slayer)
	Fixed an issue with the 'addpack command where it would try to add a pack/items to user of command instead of targeted character
	Extended the .PlaceInPack() Item JS Method to support an optional boolean argument. If true, UOX3 will attempt to automatically stack the item in question with similar items in the item's current container. New syntax:
		.PlaceInPack( autoStackFlag ) 	// autoStackFlag can be true/false
	Reduced the default maxSteps properties of advanced NPC pathfinding to improve server performance. As a result, pathfinding calculations for NPCs that are out of combat will now take ~90% less time than before, though this still takes more time than is ideal. For NPCs in combat, the improvements are not as dramatic.

13/02/2022 - Xuri (0.99.5b)
	Fixed an issue where karma titles would inadvertently have the space behind the title trimmed before being displayed in paperdoll, resulting in erroneous display of title + name there
	Fixed an issue with a cooking script (js/skill/cooking/cooking.js) where sweet dough would not get consumed properly on cooking (Dragon Slayer)
	Updated C++ function calcRegionFromXY to work with CBaseObject instead of CChar, so it also works for Items
	Items now have current town region stored as an object property during runtime. This is calculated on load, when container property is updated, and when an item is picked up or dropped. The region is also accessible via the (read-only) JS Item property .region
	Added new JS Event to allow capturing button presses from the old-school gump displayed by client via packet 0x76, which was originally used by the old-school crafting menus in T2A. The requirement for this to work is that the gump in question must have a gumpID between 0x4000 and 0xffff (which can be set when manually creating a packet with this ID via JS), and the Event itself must be in the global script:
		onScrollingGumpPress( pSock, gumpID, buttonID )
	Added new JS Event to allow better control over which names UOX3 sends to the client for characters:
		onNameRequest( myObj, requestedBy )	// return custom string, or return empty string/nothing/true/false to use default name
	Updated JS Events to also work for Items (previously only worked for Characters)
		onLightChange( myObj, lightLevel )
		onTempChange( myObj, temp )
		onWeatherChange( myObj, weatherType )
	Adjusted default temperature for town regions with no weather systems defined from 0 to 20 degrees Celsius
	Updated some JS scripts (fishing.js, baking.js and cooking.js) to make use of GetTempTag/SetTempTag rather than GetTag/SetTag
	Added cancel-checks to targeting functions in command script for add-commands (js/commands/targeting/add.js)
	Updated get command script (js/commands/targeting/get.js) to allow retrieving region ID and name using 'get region
	Updated misc command script (js/commands/custom/misc-cmd.js) to add 'gettemptag and 'settemptag commands, used to retrieve/set temporary custom tags from/on objects
	Fixed a bug where Spirit Speak skill would be checked for race languages even if the race had LANGUAGEMIN defined as 0 (or not defined at all)
	Fixed an issue where players using regular UO client would get stuck in a black void after teleporting between worlds, by adding an additional character refresh after the teleport
	Fixed an issue where crafting tools for Blacksmithing and Carpentry would attempt to fetch the value of an incorrectly named INI setting to handle durability loss for the tools
	Added new setting under [settings] section of UOX.INI to control whether it should be possible to craft weapons from coloured ingots or not:
		CRAFTCOLOUREDWEAPONS=0/1 	// If enabled(1), players can craft coloured weapons. Defaults to disabled(0)
	Fixed an issue where the correct ingots were not consumed when attempting to craft items using colored ingots
	Fixed a rogue debug message leftover in the scissor script
	Missing the type to work with the hammer and tongs to use new menu (Dragon Slayer)
	Added aliases for getting/setting colour via 'set hue # and 'get hue # (Dragon Slayer)

30/01/2022 - Dragon Slayer, Xuri
	Added speech scripts for Wisps, Orcs, Lizardmen and Ratmen (Dragon Slayer)
	Merged monster speech scripts into one common script (Xuri)
	Extended monster speech script to allow monsters to respond to specific keywords (Xuri)
	Extended monster speech script to allow monster speech to trigger from them being damaged, dying or performing a killing blow (Xuri)
	Adjusted monster speech script's sentence building to allow wisps to have more than one-letter words, and also include word-enders such as exclamation marks, full stops, question marks (Xuri)
	Added monster speech script (ID 3001) to all orc, lizardmen, ratmen and wisps in DFNs (Xuri)
	Implemented Taste ID skill in JS (Dragon Slayer)
	Extended Taste ID skill to provide some extra messages for potion-testing (Xuri)
	Fixes for Animal Lore skill, with updates to dictionaries (Xuri)

24/01/2022 - Xuri (0.99.5a)
	Improved overall performance of NPC pathfinding (by nearly 60%!) by eliminating some double-work done when checking for blocking dynamics and statics
	Optimized how the system for determining which internal map regions should have active NPCs; instead of there always being 9 active map regions surrounding any given player who's online, that number will now vary between 3 to 6 map regions, depending on how far the player is from boundaries between such map regions. This should reduce the amount of NPCs active and trying to pathfind at any given point when players are online.
	UOX3 now adapts the time between each time it checks Spawn Regions based on how "full" the Spawn Regions are on average - the nearer they are to max capacity, the longer time between each time Spawn Regions are checked
	Fixed an issue with reloading of spawn regions where UOX3 would forget about previously spawned NPCs/Items and respawn everything all over again. As part of the reload process, UOX3 now iterates over previously spawned objects and deletes these where appropriate
	Added two new races to races.dfn - Ophidian (RACE 25) and Terathan (RACE 26) - which have been setup as racial enemies
	Updated the race ID of relevant Ophidian and Terathan NPCs (dfndata/npc/arachnids.dfn and dfndata/npc/reptiles.dfn)
	Added support for NPCs engaging other NPCs in combat if they are marked as racial enemies via races.dfn
	Extended the amount of JS events supported by UOX3's JS engine from 96 to 192

		onHelpGump( pChar )			// Overrides default gump menu when pressing Help button in paperdoll
	Added new JS Event to allow preventing characters from toggling on/off war/combat mode
		onWarModeToggle( p Char )	// return false to prevent war mode toggle
	Added new JS Event to allow overriding target selection in combat for default AI behaviours:
		onAICombatTarget( pAttacker, pTarget ) // return true to select current target, or false to skip and look for another
	Updated JS onDamage() JS event to allow returning false to override and prevent damage dealt to a character. Event must now return true to allow damage to go through
	Updated JS Event onSwing to work for characters with no weapon equipped (iSwinging will be null, in this case)
	Updated JS Object Method .KillTimers() to also work for Characters, not just Items
	Added JS script that renders characters it's attached to immune to physical damage (js/npc/special/physical_immunity.js)
	Renamed shadow_elemental.js to magical_immunity.js, as it's generic script that can be attached to any NPC
	Added more pre-defined books to dfndata/misc/books.dfn (and dfndata/items/misc/books.dfn):
		A Welcome (a_welcome)			// Book by Blackthorn, dropped as loot by Betrayers
	Added definitions for additional NPCs, with scripted special abilities where applicable:
		Orc Brute (orcbrute) 			// Throws Orc Lords, cannot be targeted by provoked creatures
		Orc Chopper (orcchopper)		// Attacks deal AoE damage to nearby targets
		Betrayer (betrayer)				// Colossal Blow (stuns and peacemakes), AoE poison (2m range)
		Golem Controller (m_golemcontroller/f_golemcontroller)

08/01/2022 - Xuri (0.99.5[RC3])
	Fixed an issue in HandleGumpInput that prevented compiling UOX3 properly on Linux

	Some minor updates to crafting related scripts

06/01/2022 - Xuri (0.99.5[RC2])
	Added support for an additional optional parameter in the RESOURCE tag in Create/Crafting system to make it easier to distinguish between resources with same ID, color but different name - moreValue. This can be set for a resource using the Item DFN tag MORE=#. Syntax:
		RESOURCE=id/resourcename amount color moreValue
	Updated ResourceCount() and UseResource() JS Methods to support optional paramter moreValue
	Updated internal quantity functions (GetSubItemAmount, GetItemAmount, DeleteItemAmount, DeleteSubItemAmount, GetBankCount and DeleteBankItem) in code to also compare against moreValue, if passed in.

01/01/2022 - DragonSlayer, Xuri
	Crafting skills (Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Carpentry, Fletching, Tailoring) have been updated with new JS-based menus, up-to-date create DFNs with additional craftable items and extra features to fit the Pub15 era of UO (DragonSlayer)
	Optimized portions of new crafting menus and added some additional features (Xuri)
		Updated Character JS Method .CheckSkill to support an optional fourth parameter - isCraftSkill. This is a boolean flag that, if set to true, will use an alternate formula for skill-checks that give players at least 50% chance at success if they at least meet the minimum requirements. The formula used:
		successChance = 500 + ((( playerSkill - minSkill ) / ( maxSkill - minSkill )) * 1000
		Fixed an issue where the Rank System for crafting could mess with stacking of items; stackable items now default to max rank
		Added new Item DFN tags:
			usesleft=# 	// The current amount of uses remaining for an item with limited use
			maxuses=# 	// The maximum amount of uses for an item with limited use
		Added new JS Item properties to match DFN tags:
			.usesLeft
			.maxUses
		Updated scripts to make use of .usesLeft property instead of custom "UsesLeft" tag
		Updated DFNs to include usesleft and maxuses tags and uses_left_tooltip script for all tools with limited use
		Crafting and gathering tools bought from NPC vendors will now support a random and limited amount of uses (between what is defined as "current" and "max" uses)
		Crafting and gathering tools created by player crafters will support a limited amount of uses based on the quality of the item crafted
		Added new JS event that triggers for characters right after an item has been crafted (or failed to be crafted):
			onMakeItem( socket, crafter, craftedItem, createEntryID )

19/12/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed an issue where Socket JS Property .account did not properly return an object reference to the account associated with the socket
	Added sound-effect for when lockpicks break (js/skill/lockpicking.js)
	Cleaned up door-section of add-menu so only doors in their closed state remain (dfndata/items/building/doors.dfn)
	Misc fixes to default world templates (some missing doors, a few duplicate decorations)
	Fixed an issue where incorrect property name for max health, max stamina and max mana were used in taming script (js/skill/taming.js) and fire breath script (js/npc/special/fire_breath.js)
	Updated JS Character Method .ResourceCount() to support -1 as value for the color argument, which will cause UOX3 to count all items of the specified ID, regardless of color

29/11/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed a bug that snuck in when adding in PARENTREGION support in previous commit, that resulted in all regions being seen as sub-regions upon loading regions from regions.wsc

27/11/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed an issue where the music set for a given region would not play for characters upon login, but only after exiting/re-entering the region
	If player moves between two guarded regions with identical GUARDOWNER, they will no longer receive a message saying they're protected by the guards of the new region (since there's no change in guarded status)
	Regions marked with PARENTREGION=# (# refers to parent region number) are loaded by UOX3 as "sub-regions". Entering or existing such a sub-region will not change the actual region a player is in, but they can be assigned a different MUSICLIST that will play instead of the music in the actual region the character is in. Sub-regions like these must have a lower region number than the region they're contained within
	Added some missing dictionary entries

26/11/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4z+++)
	Added new JS Item Methods to get/set the value (0-255) for specific parts (1-4) of temp variables ("more", "morex", "morey", "morez"):
		.GetMoreVar( moreVarName, moreVarPart )
		.SetMoreVar( moreVarName, moreVarPart, moreVarValue )
	Updated Remove Trap script (js/skill/removetrap.js) to make use of GetMoreVar() and SetMoreVar methods
	Updated inRange JS event to also trigger for Items with this event attached, when player characters come within update range. Updated syntax:
		inRange( srcItem, pCharInRange )
		inRange( srcChar, objInRange )
	When UOX3 retrieves data from the onToolTip() JS event to potentially display custom object tooltips, it will use the ID specified in a temporary JS tag ("tooltipCliloc") on the object as the clilocID being sent to the client with the tooltip text returned from the script. If no such tag exists on the object, it defaults to cliloc ID 1042971.
	Added new JS event that triggers _after_ an item has been removed from a container (no return values supported):
		onContRemoveItem( iCont, objRemoved, pChar )
	The JS Function SpawnNPC() can now spawn NPCs from NPCLISTS if provided with a boolean parameter flag (useNpcList). Updated syntax:
		CChar SpawnNPC( npcSection/npclist, x, y, z, worldnumber, instanceID, useNpcList )
	Added new JS Event to allow detection of movement near an object (items only, for now). Distance at which it triggers determined by part 1 of the item's MORE property. Use long ranges with care! Syntax:
		onMoveDetect( srcObj, pChar, rangeToChar, oldCharX, oldCharY )
	Added new JS script (js/server/misc/dungeon_traps.js) for handling trap mechanics in (primarily) dungeons. The traps all trigger on collision, and use different parts of the "morez" property to determine enabled/disabled status, damage, min skill required to disarm, max skill at which player can still gain skill from disarming. Disarming renders trap inactive for 60 seconds. Implemented trap types:
		Spike Traps 		// Active for ~5 seconds after triggered, deals damage every 1 second.
		Giant Spike Trap 	// Active for ~1 second after triggered, deals high instant damage one time
		Saw Traps			// Active for ~5 seconds after triggered, deals damage every 1 second.
		Gas Traps			// Active for ~5 seconds after triggered, applies poison to target every 1 second
		Fire Column Trap 	// Active for ~5 seconds after triggered, deals damage every 1 second after initial delay of 1 second
		Stone Face Traps	// Active for ~3 seconds after triggered, deals damage every 1 second after initial delay of 1 second
		Mushroom Trap 		// Active for ~2 seconds after triggered, applies poison to target every 1 second after an initial delay of 1 second
	Added dungeon traps to 'add menu, under Buildings > Decs > Dungeon Traps
	Added new commands to make modifying IDs of items (and NPCs) easier:
		'incid #	// Increment/decrement ID of target by specified amount
		'rincid #	// Repeatedly increment/decrement ID of target/multiple targets by specified amount
	Updated 'add and 'radd commands with new, optional syntax to make adding trees easier (potentially with GM tools/macros), as it will add both trunk and leaf at same location with a single command:
		'add tree [trunkID] [leafID]
		'radd tree [trunkID] [leafID]
	Updated AreaCommand GM command to include support for setting the .decayable property on multiple items at once. Also updated the script with appropriate system messages throughout, which now also show how many items were affected by use of the command
	Added new item script (js/item/gate_opener.js) that can be used to make switches/levers raise/lower multiple nearby gates. See script comments for details on setup
	Updated various JS scripts that used GetSByte() to retrieve Z of last targeted location from Socket to manually add height of targeted tile for client version below 7.0.9 only
	Fixed an issue where items created with 'decorate load command could be set as decayable
	Fixed an issue where multiple timers could be running on a single door by manually opening and closing it repeatedly. Closing a door will now kill the associated timer on said door.
	Fixed incorrect IDs for secret doors in Item DFNs (they were off by 1, so would not work properly)
	Updated name of all secret doors in dfndata/items/building/doors.dfn to inherit name from tiledata instead
	Added secret door IDs to dfndata/harditems/harditems.dfn
	Item and NPC definitions can now make use of randomization for the ID tag, for more variety. Syntax:
		id=[id1] [id2] [etc] // Example: id=0x0e42 0x0e43
	Fixed MORE values of "hard scripted" books in dfndata/items/misc/books.dfn
	Added Ice and Fire dungeon locations (dfndata/location/location.dfn) and added these to the GM travel menu (dfndata/item/travelmenu.dfn/travelmenu.bulk.dfn)
	Fixed body ID for ancient wyrm NPCs, which also fixes their name (dfndata/npc/dragons.dfn)
	Added more pre-defined books to dfndata/misc/books.dfn (and dfndata/items/misc/books.dfn):
		Quest of the Virtues – Volume 1 	// [quest_of_the_virtues_vol1]
		Fropoz's Journal 					// [fropoz_journal]
		Translated Gargoyle Journal 		// [translated_gargoyle_journal]
		Kabur's Journal 					// [kaburs_journal]
	Updated code for spawn containers to allow spawning more than one item per container; by default, a spawn container will now spawn every item from an itemlist if set as the spawnobjlist property for that spawn container. These itemlists can contain direct item references, references to other itemlists or even lootlists
	Added 4 levels of dungeon treasure chests that can be placed out as spawn objects in dungeons, with items and valuables spawning inside on a regular interval. These can be found in dfndata/items/gmmenu/dungeon_treasure_spawners.dfn, with associated itemlists being found in dfndata/items/itemlists/itemlists.dfn (dungeontreasureloot1, dungeontreasureloot2, dungeontreasureloot3 and dungeontreasureloot4). They can also be located in the 'add menu under GM Menu > Dungeon Treasures
	Added spawn regions for dungeon treasure chests in the following areas:
		Covetous, Deceit, Despise, Destard, Fire, Hythloth, Ice, Shame, Wrong, Yew Crypts, Daemon Temple, Trinsic Passage, Cove Orc Fort, Terathan Keep, Vesper Bank, Trinsic Bank
	Updated Lockpicking skill to check for the existence of skill difficulty on locks, and use those to perform skill checks when attempting to pick those locks. Difficulty on a lock can be setup using the morey property using this syntax:
		morey=[0x00] [0x00/0x01] [0x##] [0x##] // the first part is unused, the second is used with Unlock spell, the third and fourth are the minimum skill to unlock and the max skill that can be gained from picking the lock
	Updated Unlock spell to check for existence of morey property value on lock. If there's a value, and the second part of the value is not 0x01, Unlock cannot be used to unlock the lock. By default, dungeon treasure containers level 1 and 2 are unlockable with the Unlock spell, while levels 3 and 4 are not, and require Lockpicking skill to unlock.
	Fixed an issue where player characters would "skip a step" when moving under certain circumstances (like coming out of hiding)
	Added new decorations in default world templates for the following areas:
		Covetous, Deceit, Despise, Destard, Fire, Hythloth, Ice, Shame, Wrong, Hedge Maze, Wind (city), Terathan Keep, Orc Caves, Ilshenar facet, Ilshenar dungeons
	Updated decorations in default world templates for the following areas:
		All cities in Britannia and the Lost Lands

		Lever puzzle in Covetous
		Monster-spawning brazier in Deceit
		Switch/portcullis behaviour in Hedge Maze
	Updated teleport.scp with teleport locations for:
		Hedge maze, Hythloth lvl 2 teleport maze, Wrong dungeon, Buccaneer's Den to/from mainland, various Ilshenar teleport locations
	Players flagged as criminals or non-innocent aggressors in PvP combat can no longer use public moongates
	Pets will now teleport along with the player both when using moongates (public or spell-based), recall, object-based teleporters or hard-defined teleport locations from teleport.scp

02/11/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4z++)
	Updated 'decorate save command to not save items that are inside multis (the multis themselves are not saved anyway!)
	Fixed some issues that would crash decorate script when attempting to use event subcommands without event names
	Renamed 'fixcontweight command to 'fixcont and updated it to also fix maxItems property for containers that don't already have that set
	Updated container world file template for Felucca with containers with proper maxWeight and maxItems seet
	Updated admin welcome gump (js/server/misc/admin_welcome.js) to also include containers (previously missing) and disable facets that don't have any decorations yet. Anyone who already used the admin welcome gump to place default decorations for their shards can use 'decorate load containers to add the missing containers.
	Changed how house addons are marked as addons; they will no longer have their item type set to 201 (IT_HOUSEADDON), as this would override any existing item type functionality of the items being setup as addons (like the dresser, which is a container). Instead, house addons are now marked with a custom tag "addon", which is used by scripts like axe.js to identify them as house addons instead of relying on the item type.
	Uncommented the dresser house-addon from 'add menu, as it now works as intended
	Added house-addons to ArchitectShopping SHOPLIST so they can be bought from Architect shopkeepers for roughly the cost of the material it would have taken to craft them. This is a temporary solution until crafting these have been implemented.
	Updated default region spawn file to evict the beekeeper from Skara Brae bank to make room for some actual bankers! The beekeeper is now tending to the bees outside the bank instead.
	Fixed issue where NPC vendors would not restock more than 1 leather tunic and/or leather gloves, because of a missing restock tag in the DFN entries for those items
	Removed kindling from the shoplist of Armourer vendors

	Provisioner shopkeepers will now restock more than 1 candle, lantern, various masks, kindling, flour
	Jeweler shopkeepers will now buy some gems (star sapphire and tourmaline) they were previously not so interested in
	Bowyer shopkeepers now sell fletching tools
	Added fletcher's tools as newbie item for players starting with Bowcraft/Fletching skill
	NPC shopkeepers now spawn with full stocks of goods, instead of the bare minimum
	Fixed item weight tooltip for pileable items appearing in vendor shoplists
	Fixed an issue where selling items to NPC shopkeepers would sometimes not visually remove the items from player's backpack
	Fixed missing base_item inheritance and missing restock property for mount statues sold by animal trainers/stablekeepers, which prevented them from being presented for sale
	Hairs and Beards no longer count towards the total item count showing for corpses
	All leather containers are now dyable
	Animals that belong in the Arctic (polar bears, snow leopards, walrus) will no longer spawn in forests and jungles
	Hellhounds will no longer spawn in forest and jungles; they can now only be found in dungeons
	Silver Serpents have been removed from the "weakforestlist" NPCLIST, because they are anything but
	GM/Admin characters can now drag immovable items out of their own backpack even with "allmove" disabled
	A tip to enable "allmove" or modify item's movable property now shows for GMs attempting to pick up immovable items from the ground
	Hungry creatures with AI type 6 (AI_ANIMAL) will no longer suicide by indiscriminately attacking creatures with AI type 2 (AI_EVIL), but will instead only attack "peaceful" animals, or - if really hungry - other types of predatory animals (including humans...)

31/10/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4z+)
	Fixed incorrect non-combat music entry [MUSICLIST COMBAT] section of dfndata/regions/regions.dfn

		[MUSICLIST DEATH]	// Plays music from this list for players who are in the realm of the dead
	Assigned different MOREZ value to each explosion potion (dfndata/item/magic/potions.dfn) to make distinguishing between them easier
	Updated item stacking code to disallow stacking items that have different more, morex, morey, morez, buyvalue or sellvalue
	Fixed issue where monsters would erroneously show context menu entries with skill training options
	Fixed issue where some iron ore in GM add menu was showing up and being added as a brazier instead
	Added baseRange and maxRange to 'tweak menu (js/command/targeting/tweak.js)
	Added new Item property that can be used to associate an item with a custom server event:
		DFN Tag:
			EVENT=eventName	// Name of event in one word, with no spaces
		JS Property:
			.event
	Updated 'get, 'set, 'tweak and 'areacommand commands to support the new event property
	Extended 'decorate command with some additional features to support saving, loading and unloading event decorations (example: xmas, halloween, etc):
		'decorate saveevent eventName	// Save all items with event property matching eventName to event_[eventName].jsdata
		'decorate loadevent eventName 	// Load all items from event_[eventName].jsdata and assign eventName to their event property
		'decorate unloadevent eventName	// Clear up all items associated with eventName
	Added some new house addons to house.dfn, and in the 'add menu, under Deeds > Houseaddon Deeds:

		sandstone oven (south/east)
		brick oven (south/east)
		large forge (north/south/east/west)
	Updated some house addons (bear rugs, pentagram) to be added from top-left to bottom right, for more consistency when placing items
	Added a code-check when placing house-addons to see if there's space in multi to place addon at selected location, starting from coordinates of target location and checking tiles east and south of that location based on the addon's SPACEX and SPACEY settings in house.dfn
	Added new script (js/server/house/houseAddonUse.js) that will restore the double-click functionality of some house addons that would lose their regular functionality in the process of becoming house addons, as their item type changed. The same script also adds some extra functionality to a couple of other house addons (looms and spinning wheels), allowing players to choose between using the addons and then targeting materials like yarn or wool or using the materials and then targeting the addons
	Fixed an issue with the interior decorator tool that would allow using it outside one's house
	Updated dictionary files

28/10/2021 - Xuri
	Updated onStatGained, onStatLoss and onStatChange JS events:
		Additional parameters now supported by events - statGainAmount and statLossAmount

			onStatLoss( player, statID, statLossAmount ) 	// statLossAmount is always positive
			onStatChange( player, statID, statChangeAmount ) // statChangeAmount can be negative or positive
		The return value from onStatGain and onStatLoss events can now be used to control behaviour:
			return true - stat gain/loss is allowed, and server will go through with the stat update
			return false - stat gain/loss is not allowed, server will prevent the stat update, and will prevent additional scripts with same event and/or hard code from running
		onStatChange will now run as long as onStatGain or onStatLoss events return true, and if those events are not defined
	Fixed an issue where Healing script (js/skills/healing.js) would break because Math.Round() was used instead of Math.round() (Thanks, HeyYaNITO!)
	Fixed an issue where players would experience higher than expected delays for firing ranged weapons after moving

26/10/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4z)
	Providing an invalid spellID with CastSpell() Character JS Method will no longer crash the server
	Fixed an issue where ranged weapons bought from NPC vendors would not have their baserange/maxrange properties set properly
	Added missing maxrange DFN tags to Item definitions for ranged weapons (dfndata/items/gear/weapons/archery.dfn, aos_weapons.dfn and se_weapons.dfn)
	Removed some dummy data that snuck into dfndata/items/gmmenu/spawners.dfn

24/10/2021 - Xuri
	Added an [ADMIN] section to dfndata/commands/commands.dfn to make it easier to give shard admins (via 'make admin) a different default look than other GMs
	Stackable items given to newly created characters will no longer by default be marked as newbiefied/blessed items
	Added new Character JS Properties
		.actualDexterity 		// Returns the actual dexterity (minus temporary mods) of the character
		.actualIntelligence 	// Returns the actual intelligence (minus temporary mods) of the character
		.actualStrength 		// Returns the actual strength (minus temporary mods) of the character
	Updated 'get command (js/commands/targeting/get.js) to support fetching actualDexterity, actualIntelligence and actualStrength properties for Characters
	Fixed an issue where 'wipe command could wipe NPCs and/or multis despite those being set as "unwipable"
	Fixed an issue where NPCs would be stuck not moving if they ended up trying to flee from non-existent targets

18/10/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4y)
	Shifted [directories] section of UOX.INI further up in the file, to make it easier to find
	Added new UOX.INI setting to control for which facets spawn regions are enabled (defaults to none):
		SPAWNREGIONSFACETS=#	// # is a bitmask that determines which facets to enable spawn regions for. Supported values:
			0 = No facets enabled (default)
			1 = Felucca
			2 = Trammel
			4 = Ilshenar
			8 = Malas
			16 = Tokuno
			32 = Ter Mur
				Examples: A value of 1 = only Felucca is enabled, value of 3 = Felucca + Trammel, 10 = Malas + Ilshenar, 63 = all facets enabled, etc.
	Added new Admin commands to enable/disable spawn regions in specific facets (note that this does not affect already spawned objects):
		'enablespawns <facetNum/facetName>
		'disablespawns <facetNum/facetName>
	Updated CSpawnRegion::doRegionSpawn() function to only spawn objects in spawn region if world associated with spawn region is enabled in SPAWNREGIONSFACET uox.ini setting
	The community-based spawn file now comes bundled with UOX3, and shard admins can choose whether to activate the spawns from this file during the welcome gump that pops up first time they log in
	Updated main UOX3 docs to add a simple filter feature, to make it easier to find stuff in the docs

17/10/2021 - Xuri
	Updated onSkillGain, onSkillLoss and onSkillChange JS events:
		Additional parameters now supported by events - skillGainAmount and skillLossAmount
			onSkillGain( player, skillID, skillGainAmount ) 	// skillGainAmount is always positive
			onSkillLoss( player, skillID, skillLossAmount ) 	// skillLossAmount is always positive
			onSkillChange( player, skillID, skillChangeAmount ) // skillChangeAmount can be negative or positive
		The return value from onSkillGain and onSkillLoss events can now be used to control behavior:
			return true - skill gain/loss is allowed, and server will go through with the skill update
			return false - skill gain/loss is not allowed, and server will prevent the skill update, but will not block additional scripts with same event from running
		onSkillChange will now run as long as onSkillGain or onSkillLoss events return true, and if those events are not defined
	Updated JS Docs
	
12/10/2021 - Dragon Slayer

	Added ability to heal various humanoid monsters with bandages and Healing skill
	Added ability to heal various animals with bandages and Veterinary skill (Xuri)

	Added some opening effects to some containers like armoires, chests of drawers and dressers
	Added new command to allow shard admins and GMs to quickly add signs to their world: 'addsign

30/09/2021 - Xuri

24/09/2021 - Xuri
	Added new system that lets shard admins assign a "network" budget to connected clients, which determines the maximum amount of bytes clients are allowed to send to/receive from server over a period of ten seconds. If a client exceeds these limits three times in the same connected session, they'll receive a temporary ban and get kicked from the server. The following new UOX.INI settings under the [system] section can be used to control this feature:
		MAXCLIENTBYTESIN=25000		// Max bytes client can send to server over 10 seconds
		MAXCLIENTBYTESOUT=100000 	// Max bytes client can receive from server over 10 seconds
		NETTRAFFICTIMEBAN=30 		// Duration (in minutes) of temporary ban for exceeding these limits
	Fixed an issue that prevented GMs from using CSTATS and TWEAK buttons in 'wholist
	Updated documentation with most recent changes to UOX.INI settings
	Increased MAXBUFFER size for socket operations from 2560 to 4096
	Minor code cleanup

22/09/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed bug where player might get stuck as frozen in ghost form and unable to move if dying in the midst of casting a spell
	Fixed bug where reagents could not be dropped directly from ground and into newbie reagents bag, as the bag didn't have the proper setup for a container. Now inherits its setup from a regular bag (dfndata/items/magic/reagents.dfn)
	Fixed two broken timer references in JS: Timer.SPELLRECOVERYTIME and Timer.LOYALTYTIME
	Fixed a bug where players could gain points in Evaluating Intelligence skill by targeting themselves (js/skills/evaluateintel.js)
	Updated Evaluating Intelligence skill to show more detailed information about targets (js/skills/evaluateintel.js)
	Fixed some issues with sound effects in JS based spells
	UOX3 console should now show 100% when done saving, regardless of the amount of data it has to save
	Earthquake spell can no longer harm invulnerable characters
	Fixed issue where NPC would evade instead of change to a different nearby target if unable to pathfind to current target
	Damage dealt by Fire Field spell is now determined by BASEDMG tag (defaults to 2, if resisted, half of that) in spells.dfn
	The rate at which the effects of field spells (Fire Field, Poison Field and Paralyze Field) are applied is now determined via the DAMAGEDELAY tag in spells.dfn, which defaults to 1.0 seconds
	Added missing reference to wand_item_id.js in jse_fileassociations.scp
	Removed debug message from magic item generation script
	Fixed an issue with fishing script that prevented fishing up random sea serpents
	Adjusted how updates are sent to clients when TurnToward JS Method is used, to prevent an issue where animations triggered immediately after would not play properly in the client

21/09/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4x+)
	Updated entry for Wisp in creatures.dfn to mark them as animals to stop monsters from attacking them (and dying)
	Removed some debug messages from pixie_death.js
	Fixed some lines of text in new 'add menu that would display incorrectly in regular UO client
	Disabled tooltips for admin welcome gump; too much for regular UO client to handle

20/09/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4x)
	Fixed an issue where the color of NPC corpse names would not always match up with the NPC's flag color
	Fixed a bug where the baseRange and maxRange properties of ranged weapons would not get saved to world files. These values are now saved in the format of RANGE=baseRange,maxRange
	Changed the way items are added to containers, to ensure that the order in which the items are displayed to the player always reflects the order in which they were added; now the most recent item added/moved in a container will always be rendered on top of older items.
	Made adjustments to how items are randomly added to containers; should use more of a given container gump's available area now
	Exposed Item property to JS engine, which contains serial of the creator of an item:
		.creator 	// contains serial of the creator of an item. If set, maker's marks will show up in the item's tooltip
	Fixed an issue where JS engine would lose track of script context if one script used CreateDFNItem() or SpawnNPC() functions and the new objects had events that triggered upon creation. UOX3 now restores the original script context at the tail end of these functions.
	Added new JS Event to allow inserting custom tooltip text for objects, which will be displayed in tooltips right after the object name. Any text returned from the event will be displayed, and the text can make use of the same HTML tags as gumps to make changes to color, font, etc.
		onTooltip( myObj ) 		// Triggers for objects right before the object's tooltip properties are sent to client
	Updated 'tweak and 'set commands to refresh item being modified if movable state of item changes, so the change is reflected in nearby clients
	Fixed an issue with NPC vendors and items bought from players not being properly removed from the vendor's "bought container" when players buy them again
	Ported Item Identification skill from code to JS (js/skill/itemid.js) and removed hard-coded version
	Implemented magic item generator in JS (js/item/magic_item.js). When this script is attached to an NPC, it has a chance to generate magic weapons, armors, wands/staffs and rings as loot on the NPC's corpse when slain. The chance of getting quality magical items increases with the fame level of the NPC in question. The types of magical items generated follows the pattern of such items as implemented in UO prior to the AoS expansion.
		Examples:
			exceedingly accurate war hammer of vanquishing
			substantial, accurate axe of power and Daemon's Breath
			silver long sword
			massive platemail arms of Protection
			metal shield of defense
			durable ringmail tunic of guarding
		All magic items have a chance to have spell effects attached (with rings/wands being guaranteed to have these), with a limited amount of charges available. For weapons, these effects activate on successful hits in combat, while for armors they activate on equip, and then periodically as long as the item is worn. Rings and wands/staffs have to be manually activated and targeted - with the exception of rings of invisibility, which activate the moment you equip them!
		Related scripts:
			js/item/magic_armor_equipeffects.js
			js/item/magic_weapon_accbonus.js
			js/item/magic_weapon_equip.js
			js/item/magic_weapon_spell_attack.js
		The magic item loot generation script has been attached to a number of different NPCs, all of which now have a chance to drop magic items as loot when defeated.
	A bonus magical item - the glacial staff - has also been implemented (js/item/magic_glacial_staff.js), and has a chance to drop as loot from Giant Ice Serpents!
	Fixed an issue with CustomTarget where the target message would not be displayed if the cursorType parameter was provided
	Fixed bug with 'rename command, which referenced a non-existing variable that caused a script crash
	Added additional object properties to 'get and 'set commands:
		.shouldSave 		// Determines if an item should be saved in worldfiles or not
		.baseRange 			// Determines the base range of a ranged weapon, less than which it becomes less effective
		.maxRange 			// Determines the max range of a ranged weapon, beyond which it cannot reach its target
	The feature that allows stats like Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence to provide bonuses to skill checks has been turned into a UOX.INI setting, which is disabled by default. The bonuses have also been nerfed; they will no longer contribute more to the success of a skill check than the actual skill being checked!
		STATSAFFECTSKILLCHECKS=0/1 	// If enabled, stats can provide bonuses to skill checks based on the weighting for those stats as setup in dfndata/skills/skills.dfn
	Updated damage tracking code to include the type of damage that was dealt (PHYSICAl vs HEAT vs COLD, etc)
	Updated Character JS Method Damage() to include a new parameter that can specify the type of damage that was dealt to the character. The new parameter must always be included if other optional parameters are used. Note that updates might be required for scripts making use of this method.Updated syntax:
		.Damage( amount )
		.Damage( amount, damageType )
		.Damage( amount, damageType, attacker )
		.Damage( amount, damageType, attacker, doRepsys )
		Supported damageTypes:
			PHYSICAL 	= 1
			LIGHT 		= 2
			RAIN 		= 3
			COLD 		= 4
			HEAT 		= 5
			LIGHTNING 	= 6 // magic damage
			POISON 		= 7
			SNOW 		= 8
	Updated JS Event OnDamage to include an additional parameter that describes the type of damage that was dealt. New syntax:
		onDamage( damaged, attacker, damageValue, damageType )
	Updated JS Event OnSpellTarget to allow rejecting a spell being cast on a target by returning a value of 2 from the script
	Split the character priv flag for magic reflection into a temporary one (one-time magic reflection spell) and a permanent one (innate permanent reflection ability). The temporary effect is put in place by Magic Reflection spell, and is removed after a successful spell reflect. The permanent one is an innate ability of a character and is not removed even after a spell is reflected.
	Added new Character JS property to get/set state of a character's permanent magic reflect ability:
		.permanentMagicReflect 		// 0 = disable, 1 = enable
	Added special abilities/effects for the following NPCs:
		Acid Elementals now have a chance to damage the melee weapons of their attackers
		Dull Copper Elementals now explode on death
		Shadow Iron Elemental is immune to targeted spell damage
		Copper Elementals have permanent magic reflect, and reflect some physical damage back at their attacker
		Bronze Elementals deal passive area damage to nearby players every 5 to 10 seconds
		Valorite Elementals have permanent magic reflect, reflect some physical damage back at their attacker
		Snow/Ice Elementals deal passive area damage to nearby players every 5 to 10 seconds
		Lava Serpents deal passive area damage to nearby players every 5 to 10 seconds
		Phoenixes deal passive area damage to nearby players every 5 to 10 seconds
		Pixies have a chance to cast a random spell upon receiving a death blow:
			Bless (target)
			Curse (target)
			Explosion (target)
			Greater Poison (target)
			Greater Heal (self, prevents death)
		Ethereal Warriors will now resurrect dead players with positive karma
		Ethereal Warriors now have a chance to drain target's health, stamina or mana on hit
		Fire Breath special ability added to the following NPCs, with the random ability damage scaling with the NPCs current health:
			Hell Cat, 5 to 8 dmg at max health
			Fire Steed, 6 to 9 dmg at max health
			Hell Hounds, 8 to 11 dmg at max health
			Lava Lizard, 8 to 11 dmg at max health
			Predator Hell Cat, 9 to 14 dmg at max health
			Sea Serpent, 11 to 17 dmg at max health
			Swamp Dragon, 15 to 22 dmg at max health
			Armored Swamp Dragon, 15 to 22 dmg at max health
			Fire Gargoyle, 20 to 30 dmg at max health
			Deep Sea Serpent, 21 to 32 dmg at max health
			Serpentine Dragon, 22 to 32 dmg at max health
			Drake (Gray), 22 to 32 dmg at max health
			Drake (Red), 22 to 32 dmg at max health
			Nightmare, 26 to 39 dmg at max health
			Dark Steed, 26 to 39 dmg at max health
			Silver Steed, 26 to 39 dmg at max health
			Kraken, 39 to 59 dmg at max health
			Dragon (Red), 41 to 62 dmg at max health
			Dragon (Gray), 41 to 62 dmg at max health
			Shadow Wyrm, 50 to 75 dmg at max health
			Reptalon, 51 to 77 dmg at max health
			Skeletal Dragon, 52 to 77 dmg at max health
			Ancient Wyrm, 60 to 90 dmg at max health
	Update stats, skills and loot for all currently implemented NPCs
	Removed an ancient piece of code that prevented corpses from being generated for various elementals and blade spirits on death. This was originally put in place because these creatures had no corpses, and would replace it with a backpack instead, but these creatures now all have corpses in all client versions supported by UOX3
	Updated potions script (js/item/potion.js) with updated formula for amount of hitpoints healed by healing potions, and added restrictions for using them when at full health and/or if poisoned (Dragon Slayer)
	Fixed a bug where creatures (and humans, if FORCENEWANIMATIONPACKET was disabled in uox.ini) would play animations with wrong frame count, causing the animations to either freeze for a few frames at the end, or get cut off a couple of frames early
	Implemented bonus hit chance for Archery skill, based on mention of such a bonus in Publish 5 patch notes and related UO House of Commons chat. This has been exposed as a UOX.INI setting where this bonus can be tweaked:
		ARCHERYHITBONUS=10 	// Bonus hit chance for Archery skill added to regular hit chance in combat. Defaults to 10%
	Implemented optional extra delay between moving and being able to shoot with ranged weapons in combat (in addition to whatever delay is there due to speed of the ranged weapon). This is exposed as a UOX.INI setting:
		ARCHERYSHOOTDELAY=0.5 // Minimum delay in seconds from a player stops moving until they can start to fire their ranged weapon. Defaults to 0.5s
	Fixed a bug where players who never entered combat mode could fire ranged weapons while moving
	Updated Add-menu with some improvements for usability:
		Menu now directly on the Objects (previously "Shard") tab for quicker access, with a small welcome text and quick-link button for UOX3 docs
		Settings tab contains some (persistent, will be saved with character) options for how the Add-menu behaves, along with a few quick-access buttons to some useful commands. Available options:
			Option to add chosen item at specific location instead of in GM's backpack
			Option to add chosen item repeatedly until cancelled
			Option to automatically reopen Add-menu on last menu that was open when a selection is made
			Option to force decayable state of all added items to either off (doesn't decay), on (decays) or nothing (use item default)
			Option to force movable state of all added items to either off (not movable), on (movable) or nothing (use item default)
		Added a Home button at the bottom of the menu, that takes the user back to the front page of the Add-menu regardless of which menu page they're on
	Updated Character/Socket JS Method SysMessage() with an optional parameter to specify the color used to display the system message. Updated syntax:
		.SysMessage( "Text" ) 									// Display "Text" to user as a system message with default system message color from ini
		.SysMessage( "Text %s %s", txtArg1, txtArg2 ) 			// Display "Text" to player with string arguments injected into text
		.SysMessage( txtColor, "Text" ) 						// Display "Text" to user with a specified color
		.SysMessage( txtColor, "Text %s %s", txtArg1, txtArg2 ) // Combination of text color, text and string arguments
	Fixed a bug where hair/beard items could show up inside corpses
	Fixed a bug where items could sometimes vanish (visually) from containers when bouncing back because player was not able to pick them up
	Fixed a bug where players would be unable to pick up a freely movable item from a locked down container
	Updated handling of item bouncing on pickup to use UOX3 dictionary messages instead of hard-coded client messages
	Added support for new Dictionary language:
		dictionary.POL - Polish (SERVERLANGUAGE=8 in uox.ini, or client language 83 if SERVERLANGUAGE is set to 0)
	Added taming restrictions for Unicorn, Ki-Rin and Cu Sidhe (js/skill/taming.js)
	Added modification of some creatures stats after they've been tamed (js/skill/taming.js)
	Added restrictions for who can ride certain creatures (Unicorn, Ki-Rin, Cu Sidhe)
	Updated words of power for Meteor Swarm spell to follow the same logic as other spells using Kal (Summon): Kal Des Flam Ylem
	Added new Item/Character JS Methods to get/set temporary custom tags which don't persist across worldsaves (or across reconnects, for players):
		.GetTempTag( "tagName" )
		.SetTempTag( "tagName", tagValue )
	When applying HPMAX, STAMINAMAX AND MANAMAX DFN tags to new NPCs, their current HP, STAMINA and MANA properties will now be automatically updated to match
	Fixed a server crash caused by empty speech messages sent from certain clients
	Fixed a bug that prevented teleport locations in Felucca/Trammel from working properly
	Updated calculations in code for duration and damage of existing poison strengths (1 - Lesser, 2 - Normal, 3 - Greater, 4 - Deadly) to match with ~Publish 15 (LBR/pre-AoS), and added another poison strength for monster usage (5 - Lethal)
	The strength of the Poison and Poison Field spells is now based on the average of the caster's Magery and Poisoning skills, the distance from the target (Poison spell only) and the target's Resisting Spells skill. If caster is further away than 2 tiles from target, the poison strength always equals Lesser Poison, otherwise the following rules apply:
		If caster's combined skill is higher than 100.0, poison strength equals Greater Poison, with 5% chance of Deadly Poison (if Poison spell) or Deadly Poison (if Poison Field spell)
		If caster's combined skill is higher than 70.2, poison strength equals Greater Poison
		If caster's combined skill is higher than 30.2, poison strength equals Normal Poison
		If caster's combined skill is 30.2 or lower, poison strength equals Lesser Poison
		If target resists spell, poison strength is reduced by 1 level, unless it's already at the lowest level
	Fixed an issue that would would let players move faster than they should have been allowed to
	Fixed misc issues with Party System:
		Mana and Stamina should now update for Party Members when added to the party, when going in/out of range and when their stats update while in range
		Players who get disconnected or relog should now find themselves back in the same party they were in previously
		Added system messages to inform party members about updates to their party, and to let invited players know they've successfully joined a party (or rejoined, if relogging)
	World saves now operate on the principle of only saving changes done since the last world save. Combined with the fact that NPCs in UOX3 are only active if there are players in the same/neighbouring map regions, shard owners may expect to see a decrease in world save times ranging from ~11% to ~99%, depending on how active and how spread out their player base is. If no changes have taken place since last save, saves are virtually instantaneous!

20/09/2021 - Xuri
	Extended Character JS Method DoAction() to support two additional parameters - frameCount and playBackwards - which define the length of the animation (defaults to 7) and whether the animation should be played backwards (defaults to false). Note that this only works for old-style animations, and thus is not available for Gargoyle characters. Updated method syntax:
		.DoAction( actionID ) // Old animation packet
		.DoAction( actionID, null, frameCount) // Old animation packet with frameCount
		.DoAction( actionID, null, frameCount, frameDelay ) // Old animation packet with frameCount, frameDelay
		.DoAction( actionID, null, frameCount, frameDelay, playBackwards) // Old animation packet with frameCount, frameDelay, playBackwards
		.DoAction( actionID, subActionID ) // New animation packet
	Extended fishing JS script to include:
		Fishing special fishing nets, big fish, messages in a bottle/SOS messages and associated shipwreck treasures, with chances of attracting sea serpents, deep sea serpents, water elementals and krakens while fishing.
		Enhanced detection of fishing in shallow vs deep water, with deep water now being defined as any water tile that's 16 or more tiles away from the nearest land area.
		Updated timer system, LoS checks,
	Implemented SOS messages and shipwreck locations, with areas valid for potential shipwreck locations being defined in a new section of regions.dfn named [SOSAREAS], which follows the same syntax as the INSTALOG section in the same file. Once a message in a bottle is opened, a SOS message is generated with coordinates for a random shipwreck location, which players can sail to and fish near in order to find a sunken treasure (and other items).
	Implemented shipwreck treasures, which come in 3 levels of quality (with an optional 4th quality level available), with increasing amount of gold, gems, scrolls, reagents and magic items (coming in next commit!) per quality level of treasure
	Implemented special fishing nets, which can be used to fish up a variety of sea creatures (sea serpents, deep sea serpents, water elementals, kraken), which have a high chance of having SOS bottles on their corpses when defeated
	Updated fishinglist.dfn, itemlist.dfn and lootlist.dfn to support new fishing updates
	Updated movable state of various items that can be fished up (pillows, some pieces of furniture) to ensure players can move them!
	Renamed ORERESPAWNAREA ini setting to RESOURCEAREASIZE (it's also used for ore, and logs) and reduced it from 10 to 8 to divide each world into 8x8 sized resource areas
	Fixed a bug where the new fish resource type was not getting regenerated or saved properly
	Added INSTANCEID support to INSTALOG section of regions.dfn, and added default WORLD and INSTANCEID entries to all areas
	Fixed an issue with Runebooks (js/item/runebook.js) where the coordinates of a rune location would not be displayed properly
	Separated map coordinate function from Runebook script to its own script (js/server/data/map_coordinates.js), which other scripts can call upon to get map coords using TriggerEvent() JS function
	Ported sextant implementation from code to JS (5033=js/item/sextant.js), and removed the hard-coded version of this.
	Updated Item DFN entry for sextants to include script=5033 tag
	Fixed a bug in handling of the LOOT tag for NPCs where server would crash if a number was specified behind the item/itemlist to add as loot
	The DFN tags PACKITEM and LOOT are now handled similarly when used for NPCs and Items respectively. PACKITEM can be used for adding items with specific IDs, or "list objects" from itemlists.dfn, while LOOT can be used to add items from lootlists.dfn. One big difference between these is that if the optional amount parameter is specified for either tag when used with itemlists/lootlists (PACKITEM=listObject,amount vs LOOT=lootlist,amount), PACKITEM will add the specified amount of the specified/randomly chosen item, while LOOT will add X amount of random items.
	Updated implementation of ITEMLISTs and LOOTLISTs to support an optional weighting system, which can be used to adjust the probability of some items being chosen from these lists over other items. In the below example, specialfishingnet has a weight of 10, while the blank entry has a weight of 90, making it 9 times more likely for the blank entry to be chosen than the specialfishingnet! Note that higher weighted items should be sorted first for this to be accurate:
		[LOOTLIST shipwreck_treasure_special]
		{
		90|blank
		10|specialfishingnet
		}
	Using bladed weapons on stacks of fish will now cut the entire stack at once, instead of one fish at a time
	Updated DFN entries for various sea creatures (dfndata/npc/seacreatures.dfn) to adjust color of NPCs, loot and NPC AI
	Extended functionality of JS Function DoMovingEffect() to allow a set of coordinates as source location, without having to specify a character as either the source or target of the effect
	Fixed an issue with sea creatures being unable to pathfind in shallow water due to underwater land tiles being treated as blocking

02/08/2021 - Dragon Slayer
	Moved fishing skill out of code and into js for more user friendly control
	Added js/item/magicfish.js for the magic fish food

08/08/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed an issue where AF_ALL option in [disabled assistant features] of UOX.INI would override (duh) the setting for all the other assistant features, essentially leaving the shard admin with only two options (all features disabled, or none). The AF_ALL option has now been removed entirely.
	Extended support for negotiating with assistant tools to disable these additional assistant tool features (from UOS) via the [disabled assistant features] section of UOX.INI:
		AF_AUTOBANDAGE=0/1 			// Automatically apply bandages when low on health
		AF_ENEMYTARGETSHARE=0/1 	// Share enemy target in party/guild/alliance chat
		AF_FILTERSEASON=0/1 		// Force client to display a fixed season
		AF_SPELLTARGETSHARE=0/1 	// Share spell target in party/guild/alliance chat
		AF_HUMANOIDHEALTHCHECKS=0/1 // Check health of nearby humanoid characters?
		AF_SPEECHJOURNALCHECKS=0/1 	// Check journal for specific messages sent from server
	Applied a potential fix for an issue that could cause players to get disconnected immediately without delay before assistant tool had a chance to respond to feature negotiation request
	Addressed a couple of minor code issues that caused some warnings

08/08/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4w)
	Added support for new Skills DFN tag:
		SKILLDELAY=# 	// Delay in seconds before another skill can be used after using this skill. Overrides global delay from UOX.INI
	Updated skill cSkills::SkillUse() to use skill-specific skill delays if set for a given skill, or global delay from ini if not. Also added a check to see if skill delay timer has been modified by onSkill JS event before attempting to set a default timer
	Updated skill delays to better match ~pub15 era:
		Reduced global SKILLDELAY setting in UOX.INI from 2 to 1 second
		Detecting Hidden skill now has a default skill delay of 10 seconds
		Herding skill now has a default skill delay of 10 seconds
		Hiding skill now has a default skill delay of 10 seconds, with shorter delays (global skill delay) for trying to hide while in combat or for successfully hiding
		Meditation skill now has a default skill delay of 10 seconds, with shorter delays (global skill delay) for failing due to hands being occupied or already being at max mana
		Peacemaking skill now has a default skill delay of 10 seconds for failed skill checks, and 5 seconds delay for successful ones
		Poisoning skill now has a default skill delay of 10 seconds
		Provocation skill now has a default skill delay of 10 seconds
		Remove Trap skill now has a default skill delay of 10 seconds
		Stealing skill now has a default skill delay of 10 seconds
		Stealth skill now has a default skill delay of 10 seconds
		Tracking skill now has a default skill delay of 10 seconds
		Veterinary skill now has a default skill delay of 10 seconds
	Fixed an issue with global JS Timer object that would reference the wrong timerIDs
	Extended global JS timer object to include timers from socket as well (marked with SOCK_ prefix):
		.SOCK_SKILLDELAY	// Delay before the next time player can use another skill
		.SOCK_OBJDELAY		// Delay before next time player can use another object
		.SOCK_SPIRITSPEAK 	// Timer that tracks remaining duration of player's Spirit Speak
		.SOCK_TRACKING		// Timer that tracks remaining duration for player's Tracking skill
		.SOCK_FISHING		// Timer that tracks remaining duration for player's Fishing skill
		.SOCK_MUTETIME 		// Timer that tracks remaining duration a player remains muted
		.SOCK_TRACKINGDISPLAY 	// Timer that tracks interval between each time tracking display is updated
	Updated various JS scripts to use the new Timer.TIMERNAME with .GetTimer()/.SetTimer() JS Methods for Characters and Sockets
	Updated Persecution ability for player ghosts to use the skill delay of the Spirit Speak skill, if set
	Updated Persecution ability to base mana damage primarily on player's Spirit Speak skill rather than their Intelligence
	In order to cut down on the amount of messages sent from server to players trying to spam-use objects/skills, UOX3 now only sends a maximum of one message for object use delay and one message for skill use delay while the delay timers for these are in effect. This resets on the next successful use of an object or skill. This is tracked via bools in cSocket class:
		bool objDelayMsgShown
		bool skillDelayMsgShown
	Converted DELAY tag in spells.dfn to use seconds (with decimals) instead of tenths of a second, which was not precise enough. This controls the cast time of spells. What would previously say DELAY=10 (10/10ths of a second) now says DELAY=1.0 (1 second)
	Added support for new Spells DFN tag to control delay until damage takes place after casting a spell, replacing UOX.INI setting COMBATEXPLODEDELAY, which is no longer used:
		DAMAGEDELAY=# 		// Delay in seconds (decimal) until a direct damage spell deals its damage
	Added support for a new Spells DFN tag to control cast recovery time, during which additional spells cannot be cast:
		RECOVERYDELAY=# 	// Delay in seconds (decimal) until player can cast another spell
	Added new setting in UOX.INI to control whether player spellcasting gets interrupted upon equipping/picking up items:
		ITEMSINTERRUPTCASTING=1 	// If enabled, spellcasting gets interrupted by equipping/picking up items. Defaults to enabled.
	All direct damage spells by default have a 1.0s delay before damage (and VFX) is applied, except Explosion which has a 2.5s delay
	All spells by default have a cast recovery duration of 1.0s; from the moment a spellcast is completed/moment targeting cursor appears, the player will be unable to cast any other spell for the duration of the cast recovery
	Reagent checks and skill-check now take place AFTER the spellcast animation, not before!
	Spell cast times now follow this formula, though values set per spell and can be modified: 0.25 + ( spellCircle * 0.25 )
	Overhauled spell sound FX and VFX for for all spells
	Players can no longer cast spells while holding items on the cursor
	Fixed Magic Trap, Magic Untrap, Magic Lock and Magic Unlock not being usable on containers in one's own backpack
	Fixed an issue that caused Magic Trap to deal between 50 to 100 damage to the player. New damage: 5 to 10, depending on Magery skill
	Fixed an issue where Magic Untrap spell would completely remove traps from spawn containers instead of disable them
	Fixed an issue where Telekinesis spell would not set off traps on containers properly
	Added additional FX for Teleport spell played at player's original location before the teleport took place
	Fixed a bug where creatures summoned with the Summon Creature spell were not dispellable
	Fixed an issue where the Reveal spell would not reveal players hidden using the Hiding skill
	Dispel and Mass Dispel spells are no longer guaranteed to succeed at dispelling summoned creatures. Instead, the chance to dispel is based on the following simple formula, with dispelChance capped at 95% to always leave some chance for a creature to resist a dispel:
		dispelChance = ( 50 - ( targetResistSkill - casterMagerySkill )) / 1.5
			The targetResistSkill is based on the highest value of the summoned creature's spell resistance skill and the spell resistance skill of its summoner
	Fixed an issue where the Create Food spell attempted to create an invalid item
	Fixed issue where code that checked for valid drop locations for items didn't allow negative z values (Dragon Slayer)
	Fixed issue where players could drop items on blocking map tiles like water or mountains (Dragon Slayer)
	Fixed issue where some JS functions like CheckStaticFlag, CheckDynamicFlag, DoesStaticBlock, DoesDynamicBlock and DoesMapBlock would not work correctly when passed negative Z values
	Fixed issue where context menu were listing skills to train from NPCs based on effective skill rather than base skill
	Fixed issue where NPCs would offer skills for training even if those skills were not above the minimum 60 skillpoints
	Updated clilocID used for Gump JS Method AddToolTip - as well as for some item/character tooltip data - from 1050045 to 1042971 for improved client compatibility
	Human/Elf/Gargoyle NPCs with spellcasting capabilities will now play a casting animation and briefly stop moving when they cast spells
	Updated NPC spellcasting code to help NPCs make a bit better choices of what spells to cast during combat. Now they take their own health percentage into account, and cast more offensive spells when at near full health vs more defensive spells as their health drops
	Fixed an issue where Hirelings wouldn't always immediately start following their new owners
	Fixed a bug where the Earthquake spell could incorrectly add NPC characters marked for deletion to the refresh queue
	Updated skills and stats of all implemented human NPCs (including vendors) to better match the state of those NPCs around the time of Pub15
	Fixed SPATTACK values for a couple of NPCs that were still using values based on spell bitmask instead of spell circle value
	Updated stats of Jukan and Meer NPCs (dfndata/npc/lbrraces.dfn) to match stats from official LBR guide
	Added support for an optional third parameter for Character/Socket JS Method .CustomTarget() to allow highlighting targeting cursors as neutral (0, default aura), harmful (1, red aura), helpful (2, blue aura). A value of 3 will cancel the currently active targeting cursor. New syntax:
		myChar/mySock.CustomTarget( targetID, txtToSay, cursorType ) 	// supported cursorTypes: 0 = neutral, 1 = harmful, 2 = helpful, 3 = cancel current target cursor
	Various target cursors triggered by code (like hard-coded spells, some pet commands) also make use of these cursorTypes
	Fixed a bug that caused segmentation fault on Linux, related to item tooltips and socket language

01/08/2021 - Xuri
	Added Fish as another resource type (in addition to logs and ore) for UOX3 to keep track of and respawn based on resource areas
	Added new UOX.INI settings to control the availability of and respawn times for fish:
		FISHPERAREA=10 			// Maximum number of fish in a given resource area
		FISHRESPAWNTIMER=600 	// Amount of time it takes for 1 single fish to respawn in a resource area
		FISHRESPAWNAREA=10 		// Number of fish-areas to split the world into
	Exposed the fish resource type to Resource JS functions, which now take "FISH" as an additional resource type on top of "LOGS" and "ORE:
		ResourceTime( resourceType ) 		// Return respawn timer for specified resource type
		ResourceTime( resourceType, int ) 	// Set respawn timer (in seconds) for specified resource type
		ResourceAmount( resourceType ) 		// Get max amount of resources per resource area for specified resource type
		ResourceAmount( resourceType, int ) // Set max amount of resources per resource area for specified resource type
		ResourceArea( resourceType ) 		// Get number of resource areas that world has been split into for specified resource type
		ResourceArea( resourceType, int ) 	// Set number of resource areas to split the world into for specified resource type
	Updated Resource JS properties with properties to get current amount of fish in a region, and the current respawn timer for fish:
		.fishAmount		// Returns/Sets the amount of fish in given resource object
		.fishTime		// Returns/Sets the respawn timer of fish in given resource object
	Updated fishinglist.dfn (dfndata/items/itemlists/fishinglist.dfn) with list objects that can be referenced by in-game ADD command or scripts to add random items from the fishing itemlists

	Added a Newbie Check so you can not cut up your starting items.
	Added new Character JS property to detect if a character is running, which also accounts for sprinting while mounted, or fast flying for characters who can fly (Xuri):
		.isRunning 		// Returns true if character is running, false if they're walking
	Updated scissors script to verify that scissors still exist and are within range upon targeting an object, and a check to ensure characters cannot use scissors while running (Xuri)
	Updated scissors script to base the amount of returned cloth/leather from cut up clothes/leather armor on the amount of resources used to craft the items, as well as on the player's Tailoring skill. The higher the player's skill, the more resources returned, capped at half the amount of resources used to craft the item. If the item was not crafted by a player, it returns 1 resource only. (Xuri)
	Updated Tailoring script (js/skills/tailoring.js) to accept cut leather as a valid tailoring resource

01/08/2021 - Xuri

	Fixed a bug with PACKITEM tag which seeped in with previous commit, which could cause a server crash due to incorrect handling of the tag data
	Blank recall runes will no longer have a tooltip with the world the runes were marked in
	A west-facing rune with item ID 0x1f17 has been added to represent blank, unmarked runes. This is now the rune that vendors sell, and which can be added through the magic-portion of the 'add menu. Upon being marked by a Mark spell, the rune will change ID to the north-facing one with ID 0x1f14. This is to accommodate the Inscription crafting skill, which will use the blank 0x1f17 runes as a crafting resource.
	Inscription skill can now be used to craft Runebooks. In addition to the skill requirement (min 45.0 Inscription), it requires 8 blank scrolls, 1 blank recall rune, 1 Recall scroll and 1 Gate Travel spell.
	Added new item type - IT_RUNEBOOK (49)
	Added new item definition for Runebook ([runebook]) to dfndata/items/magic/misc_magic.dfn

	Ghosts can no longer "speedhack" by spamming the tab button to go in and out of combat rapidly
	Updated various JS item scripts to unhide characters when the items are used (Dragon Slayer)

29/07/2021 - Dragon Slayer
	Implemented Remove Trap skill, which depends on player's detect hidden and lockpicking skills being at least 50.0, and removes or fails to remove traps based on trap difficulty vs skill checks. Trap difficulty is set in the last part of a 4-part MOREZ value, using the following format:
		MOREZ=0x01 0x32 0x11 0x37 	// First part is trap enabled/disabled, second part is damage dealt by trap, third part is minimum remove trap skill required to remove trap, and fourth part is minimum skill required for guaranteed removal success

		.orneriness
	Every time a tamed pet is released or goes wild, its "orneriness" increases, making it more difficult for other players to tame, and more difficult for anyone to control.
	Updated CBasePetResponse::canControlPet() function to use pet control difficulty system if enabled, which checks player's animal taming/animal lore skill vs a pet's "orneriness" to determine chance of pet accepting a given pet command

		.InitiateCombat( targetChar )	// Character attempts to initiate combat with target character
	Updated parrying portion of combat code to be in line with Pub15/pre-AoS parrying mechanics. High AR shields now absorb more damage on a successful parry, while low AR shields have a higher chance of parrying.

	Added new function in combat.cpp - AdjustArmorClassDamage() - which adjusts the damage dealt in combat based on whether armour class (AC DFN tag or .ac JS property) of weapon and armour equipped on hit location of target match up. A weapon with armour class 1 would essentially be doubly effective against armour of armour class 1. Allows setting up things like piercing weapons being better against some armor types than mace weapons, etc.
	Added new UOX.INI setting under [combat] to enable/disable double damage from armour class bonuses:
		ARMORCLASSDAMAGEBONUS=0/1 //defaults to 0)

06/07/2021 - Xuri
	Updated how UOX3 handles more, morex, morey and morez properties:
		DFN tags for these properties can now handle data in multiple formats. Example:
			MORE=1285, MORE=0 0 5 5, MORE=0x00 0x00 0x05 0x05, MORE=0x00000505
		JS command 'set more/morex/morey/morez now accepts any of the above formats

		JS command 'tweak will now display hex value for these properties in a tooltip
	Fixed an issue with target-based spells (like Magic Lock/Unlock, Magic Trap/Untrap, Telekinesis) that used the inverse result of a distance check to determine if players could cast such a spell at an item
	Fixed an issue where players could keep spawn containers open on screen to access items respawning inside without having to unlock/untrap container again after a respawn
	Locked containers (and spawn containers) will now show [Locked] in the item tooltip
	Spawn containers will now be re-trapped when new items spawn, if they were trapped originally. To trap a container:
		MOREZ=0x01 0x32 0x00 0x00 // 0x01 marks container as trapped, 0x32 says "deal 50 damage" when trap is set off
	Fixed trapped spawn containers not dealing damage when trap is set off due to magic damage function in source requiring a valid attacker (now no longer does)
	Updated source and scripts to use cliloc id 1050045 for custom tooltips rather than 1114778, as 1050045 is available in all client versions that support tooltips
	Added new JS Function to force-trigger a trapped item, as if the player tried to open a trapped container:
		TriggerTrap( pChar, iTrap )
	Updated JS docs with some missing Functions/Methods

	UOX3 now sends the appropriate packets (0x85 and/or 0x86) in response to client requests to delete a character from the char selection screen
	Fixed an issue with fetching create entries in JS - was incorrectly limited by number of registered spells!
	More code cleanup

04/07/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed an issue with ItemID skill where using the skill on a crafted item would not output a result if creator of item was unknown
	Command logs now also include any parameters used with a command
	Fixed an issue where messages used with CustomTarget JS function would not get truncated properly if longer than the allowed maximum length
	Fixed some instances of potential buffer overrun and/or out-of-bounds memory access
	Fixed some potential null pointer dereferences
	Fixed a couple instances of missing breaks in switch cases
	Added [[maybe_unused]] attributes in places where return values are intentionally unused
	Added [[fallthrough]] attributes in places where switch case fallthroughs are intentional
	Fixed some issues with converting account data from older (pre 0.99) versions of UOX3
	Misc minor code cleanup

02/07/2021 - Xuri
	Corpse parts carved from human corpses will now have weight, and decay - as they're added as script items instead of base items
	Fixed some memory leaks in CMultiObj::GetBuildTimestamp(), CMultiObj::GetTradeTimestamp(), CWorldMain::SaveNewWorld() and cEffects::tempeffect()
	Misc smaller code cleanup

30/06/2021 - Xuri
	Added new UOX.INI settings under [speedup] section to control global speed of mounted NPCs:
		NPCMOUNTEDWALKINGSPEED=0.3
		NPCMOUNTEDRUNNINGSPEED=0.12
		NPCMOUNTEDFLEEINGSPEED=0.2
	Added new NPC DFN tags to allow overriding global mounted movement speeds:
		FLEEINGSPEEDMOUNTED=#
		RUNNINGSPEEDMOUNTED=#
		WALKINGSPEEDMOUNTED=#

29/06/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4t)
	Exposed crafting entries to JS engine, along with associated properties from the crafting DFNs:
		New JS Object types
			CreateEntries	// Global JS object containing all item entries loaded from create DFNs
			CreateEntry		// A specific create entry retrieved from global object. Example:
				var createEntry = CreateEntries[7] // Fetches item entry #7 from create DFNs
		New CreateEntry JS Properties
			id			// itemID of item to craft
			name		// name of item entry from create DFNs
			addItem 	// section header of item to craft from item DFNs
			colour		// colour of crafted item
			sound		// sound played when crafting item
			minRank		// minimum rank value used by rank system to provide variable stats to crafted items
			maxRank		// maximum rank value used by rank system to provide variable stats to crafted items
			delay		// delay in milliseconds for crafting to finish
			spell		// spell ID primarily used when inscribing magic scrolls
			resources	// list of resources needed to craft item.
				resources[n][0] // amount of resource needed
				resources[n][1] // resource colour required
				resources[n][2] // list of IDs accepted as resource material
			skills		// list of skills requirements to craft item
				skills[n][0]	// skillNumber of skill required to craft item
				skills[n][1]	// minimum skill at which player will always fail to craft item
				skills[n][2]	// maximum skill at which player will always succeed to craft item
			avgMinSkill	// average minimum skill required to smelt item
			avgMaxSkill	// average maximum skill required to smelt item
	Fixed a bug with tracking menu that could cause UOX3 to crash when cancelling/closing the menu

27/06/2021 - Dragon Slayer
	Added [hairrestyledeed] item that lets (human) players restyle their hair
	Added script for handling hair restyle (js/item/hairrestyle.js) and added it to jse_fileassociations.scp with ID 5028
	Updated hair restyle script with some coding style changes, added system messages to dictionary files and added gump tooltips (Xuri)

27/06/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed an issue with JS Function DeleteFile(), which would stop calling script from working if no file was found for deletion. Could break demolishing of houses, amongst other things
	Fixed an issue with DoSEErrorMessage() function that prevented JS function error messages from being displayed in UOX3 console if message size was below 512
	Fixed a bug that allowed players to place items on the same slot of walls when using a client that doesn't automatically restrict this
	When dropping items, UOX3 will now look for a valid surface to drop them on, and move the item to said valid surface if applicable
	Fixed an issue with loading of MultiCollections.uop where max boundaries of each multi was not set on load, preventing features that relied on finding corners of building from working (like automatic ban location detection for houses)
	Added new function in mapstuff.cpp to check flags on dynamic items, and exposed it as a JS Function with same name and parameters:
		CheckDynamicFlag( SI16 x, SI16 y, SI08 oldz, UI08 worldNumber, UI16 instanceID, TileFlags toCheck );
	Fixed an issue where items were not always properly added to/removed from map regions when picked up or dropped
	Added new helper function in dist.cpp to find 3D distance between two points:
		getDist3D( point a, point b )
	Added JS Function - DistanceBetween() - to find distance between two sets of coordinates, or two objects:
		DistanceBetween( x1, y1, x2, y2 )
		DistanceBetween( x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2 )
		DistanceBetween( sourceObject, targObject )
		DistanceBetween( sourceObject, targObject, checkZ )
	Added Item JS Method - GetTileName() - to get name of an item directly from tiledata
	Added new UOX.INI setting that defines the lower limit for when a purchase will withdraw money from bank instead of backpack:
		BANKBUYTHRESHOLD=2000
	Split the UOX.INI setting CONSOLELOG into three parts, to enable/disable different forms of logging:
		CONSOLELOG=1/0 	// Toggles logging of console messages, warnings and errors
		NETWORKLOG=1/0 	// Toggles logging of network traffic
		SPEECHLOG=1/0 	// Toggles logging of player/staff speech

23/06/2021 - Dragon Slayer
	Added [interiordecorator] tool (dfndata/items/misc/uor_misc.dfn) that can be used to raise, lower or rotate locked down items in houses
	Added script for rotating furniture via interior decorator tool or via dropping item
	Merged furniture rotating functionality into existing smartturn script, and expanded on the selection of items. Supported furniture can now be turned by double-clicking the item (if no other double-click functionality exists), picking up and dropping the item, or via the interiordecorator tool (Xuri)
	Updated js/jse_objectassociations.scp with furniture IDs supported by the furniture_smartturn script, so rotating will work for any supported furniture without needing to add scripts to each individual furniture DFN (Xuri)
	Added system messages to dictionary files (Xuri)
	Added interior decorator tool to Architect shoplists (Xuri)

23/06/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed an issue with CChar::RemoveAllObjectsFromSight(), which failed to remove nearby multis from sight, leading to ghost images when changing worlds/instances
	Added check for other multis when sailing - boats will now collide with other boats!
	Added check for dynamic items when sailing - boats will now collide with blocking objects
	Added "wrapping" support for maps 0 and 1 when sailing, meaning a ship can sail around the world in both N/S and E/W directions.
	Added new [magic] section in uox.ini with the following settings:
		TRAVELSPELLSFROMBOATKEYS=1 		// Toggle being able to travel via Recall and Gate spells directly to a boat via its key
		TRAVELSPELLSWHILEOVERWEIGHT=0 	// Toggle being able to travel via Recall and Gate spells when overweight
		MARKRUNESINMULTIS=1 			// Toggle being able to mark runes while inside multis. If enabled, runes marked inside multis will be associated with the multi in question, rather than a specific set of coordinates. If multi no longer exists, travelling to it via Recall or Gate will be impossible
		TRAVELSPELLSBETWEENWORLD=0 		// Toggle being able to travel via Recall and Gate spells from one facet to another
		TRAVELSPELLSWHILEAGGRESSOR=0	// Toggle being able to travel via Recall and Gate spells when marked as an aggressor (if attacked an innocent first, or if criminal)
	Fixed an exception that would only rear its head when running UOX3 in debug mode, by adding new function void CBaseObject::RemoveFromRefreshQueue(), which when called from the end of the Cleanup() process for an object will ensure it's removed from the refreshQueue (thanks giwo!)
	Fixed several issues with the regional spawning system:
		NPCs would quite often get created, only to be deleted shortly after because the system failed to find a valid spawn location. This part of the system has now been rewritten to look for a valid spawn location before actually spawning the NPC, to avoid unnecessary creation/deletion of characters
		Spawn system would not continue looking for a valid spawn location past the first failure (when it was supposed to make 100 attempts before giving up)
		Spawn system would not look for valid water tiles for ocean-based/amphibian creatures if valid land tiles could not be found. As a result, amphibian creatures that could have spawned on either land or water would only ever spawn on land.
		DoesMapBlock() function checked for TF_BLOCKING tile flag before it checked if waterwalking was allowed and if tile had TF_WET flag. As a result, no purely ocean-based creatures would spawn at all because no valid spawn locations could ever be found

22/06/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4s)
	Updated Character JS Method .Follow() to allow optional null parameter to clear follow target for an NPC
	Added new Character JS Method .Dupe(), exposing code functionality to duplicate a character and returning the new character object to scripts. Example:
		var newChar = myChar.Dupe()
	Updated GM command 'dupe to work with characters as well as items
	The colour of blood effects for characters and creatures hit in combat can be defined in dfndata/race/races.dfn using the BLOODCOLOUR tag and a colour ID. If the value 0xffff is provided, the colour of the blood will be inherited from the character's colour, if any
	Moved splitting of NPCs in combat from hard code to JS (js/npc/ai/splitting_npcs.js). It relies on the onAttack JS event to trigger, but otherwise works identical to the previous hard-coded variant. The script has been assigned a default script ID of 3203
	Added SCRIPT=3203 tag to [slime]/[jwilson] NPCs (dfndata/npc/miscmonsters.dfn)
	Added new race for slime-related creatures (RACE 24 in dfndata/race/races.dfn), with a BLOODCOLOUR tag set to 0xffff to let blood effects inherit the colour of each individual slime
	Updated RACE tag for [slime]/[jwilson] NPCs to use the new slime-race (dfndata/npc/miscmonsters.dfn)
	Fixed an issue where UOX3 would attempt to update health bar of training dummies not marked as damageable (js/item/trainingdummy.js)
	Added packet-hook script (js/server/network/0x7f_uogatewayServerPoll.js) to handle responses to server polling by shard lists like UOGateway, ShardPortal, etc.
	Removed old and outdated UOG response code from network.cpp, along with UOXMONITOR response (an old tool no longer found in the wild)
	Extended packet overloading to include packets received on first connection, to allow custom responses to things like UOG server poll and other early incoming packets
	Adjusted code that spawns blood effects when taking damage to only happen for damage values higher than 1% of max health, or 1 (whichever is higher)
	Adjusted code that prevents stamina regen from taking place if a character is thirsty to allow generating up to 25% of max stamina, to prevent characters from being unable to move due to thirst!
	Added new settings in uox.ini to enable/disable the hard-coded hunger and thirst systems, with thirst system being disabled by default:
		HUNGERENABLED=1 // defaults to 1. Affects hunger of players, tamed pets, animal AI
		THIRSTENABLED=0 // defaults to 0. Affects thirst of players, tamed pets, animal AI
	Responses to UOG/CUO server poll requests are now enabled in uox.ini by default

20/06/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed an error introduced with previous commit that caused some issues with the handling of items upon player death/resurrection
	Fixed an error where items that had AR/resistances with values lower than 10 would lose those values after a restart (for instance wooden buckler)

17/06/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed a potential server crash issue with OnUnequipAttempt JS event
	Added additional parameter to onCombatDamageCalc JS event - hitLoc, which contains the hit location calculated by code for an attack. New syntax:
		onCombatDamageCalc( pAttacker, pDefender, fightSkill, hitLoc )
	Moved CalculateHitLoc() and DoHitMessage() out of CHandleCombat::calcDamage(), so these can still happen if JS scripts override damage calculations using onCombatDamageCalc event
	Hairs/Beards inside corpse containers now not movable, even if displayed in client for some reason

16/06/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4r)
	Updated default item decay timer from 300s to 1800s (30 minutes)
	Updated default corpse decay timer from 900s to 420s (7 minutes)
	Updated default blood decay timer for corpses from 450s to 210s (3.5 minutes)
	Added new UOX.INI setting that determines decay timer for NPC corpses (previously used regular decay timer):
		NPCCORPSEDECAYTIMER=420
	Updated onDecay JS event to support triggering in global script
	Added onDecay event to default global script (js/server/global.js), which detects when player corpses are about to decay, turns them into bones, and resets the decay timer back to full
	Fixed an issue that snuck in with regards to fetching server setting for BLOODEFFECTCHANCE in JS engine

15/06/2021 - Xuri
	Added cEffects::SpawnBloodEffect( UI08 worldNum, UI16 instanceID, UI16 bloodColour, BloodTypes bloodType ), which can be called upon to create blood splatter effects for things like death, bleeding, combat hits, etc.
	Added random blood effects that spawn when a character dies, and decays according to new ini setting
	Added new UOX.INI settings under [timers] to define how long blood effects take to decay:
		BLOODDECAYTIMER=3 			// Smaller blood effects spawned during combat, defaults to 3 seconds
		BLOODDECAYCORPSETIMER=450 	// Larger blood effects spawned upon death, defaults to half the duration of the default corpse decay timer
	Fixed an issue with Forensic Evaluation skill (js/skills/forensics.js) not giving correct info on age of a corpse, because it incorrectly tried to check a .tempTime property instead of .tempTimer
	Changed default value of MSGREDISPLAYTIME in [tracking] section of UOX.INI from 30 to 3, so tracking arrow will actually follow the target when it moves (every 3 seconds)
	Fixed an issue with the Tracking skill where attempting to left-click on the tracking arrow would cause client to freeze up
	Fixed an issue with the Tracking skill where right-clicking tracking arrow to dismiss it would not always work, especially if target had been killed/deleted
	Fixed an issue with the Tracking skill where the tracking arrow would not be automatically dismissed if the tracked target was killed/deleted
	Fixed an issue that prevented clients in 6.0.5 - 6.0.14.1 range from connecting even though CLIENTSUPPORT6050 was enabled in ini
	Fixed an issue where client 6.0.14.2 was being mis-classified as a T2A client, and not the first of the SA clients as it should be
	Changed how Race damage modifier is applied to damage dealt in combat - it's now a direct percentage bonus (or penalty) applied to the base damage dealt
	Added in missing default [COMBAT MODS] section to dfndata/race/races.dfn. Each MOD# entry in this section represents a percentage modifier applied to skill checks for members of a race that subscribes to that MOD entry via skill tags like [SKILLNAME]G=# (bonus) or [SKILLNAME]L=# (penalty). These modifiers are also applied to base damage in combat, before other damage modifiers.
		Example1: SWORDSMANSHIPG=3 would apply a 20% bonus to swordsmanship skill checks for race the tag was added to, as well as a 20% bonus to base damage dealt in combat
		Example2: MACEFIGHTINGL=3 would apply a 20% penalty to macefighting skill checks for race the tag was added to, as well as a 20% penalty to base damage dealt in combat

13/06/2021 - Xuri
	Some fixes to IP4Address code and output to console of which type of IP being listened (punt)

13/06/2021 - Xuri
	Updated UOX3 documentation to reflect recent changes to IP handling/config, addition of 'decorate command and world templates, updated instructions for building from source
	Added missing world template file (js/jsdata/worldtemplates/felucca_containers.jsdata)
	Fixed an issue with how UOX3 lists out IP addresses it's actively listening to (punt)
	
12/06/2021 - punt
	Following changes made to ensure compatable with some of my other projects
		Switched over to ConfigOS.h from Config.h
		UOX_PLATFORM to PLATFORM (and the corresponding platform types)
	Replaced NULL with nullptr
	
12/06/2021 - Xuri
	Some minor cleanup in a few DFN files. Affected files:
		dfndata/creatures/creatures.dfn
		dfndata/items/gear/weapons/aos_weapons.dfn
		dfndata/items/magic/reagents.dfn
		dfndata/items/misc/equippable-mounts.dfn
		dfndata/items/misc/gems.dfn
		dfndata/items/npcmenu.bulk.dfn
		dfndata/items/skills/misc/misc.dfn
		dfndata/npc/femalevendors.dfn
		dfndata/npc/mounts.dfn
		dfndata/npc/undead.dfn

12/06/2021 - Xuri
	Updated decorate command to support two additional object categories - containers and spawners - and the properties needed by these to function
	Fixed an issue with appending folder names to paths in File JS Method .Open() and JS File Function DeleteFile()
	Renamed default UOX3 server name (was too long) to My UOX3 Shard
	Rewrote server IP handling (new files: IP4Address.hpp/cpp) and did away with the need for the [play server list] section and SERVERLIST entries in uox.ini. UOX3 now automatically accepts and responds to connections on both local and LAN IPs, as well as an optional external/WAN ip defined in uox.ini tag EXTERNALIP, with server name defined by the existing SERVERNAME tag in the ini (punt)

11/06/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4q)
	Added entry for a new directory path in uox.ini:
		SCRIPTDATADIRECTORY=./js/jsdata/ - dedicated to generic data read/written by JS scripts, data not directly linked to live content, which should not live or die by the state of the SHAREDDIRECTORY. Existing scripts will continue to write/read files in the SHAREDDIRECTORY if no changes are made.
	Updated JS File Method .Open() to support an optional fourth argument (requires third argument):
		useScriptDataDir (boolean) - when this fourth argument is included as true, UOX3 will look for the file in the SCRIPTDATADIRECTORY instead of the SHAREDDIRECTORY. Third argument - folderName - is required for this fourth argument to be used. New syntaxes:
			.Open( fileName, fileMode )
			.Open( fileName, fileMode, folderName )
			.Open( fileName, fileMode, folderName, useScriptDataDir )
	Updated JS File Function DeleteFile() to support an optional third argument (requires second argument):
		useScriptDataDir (boolean) - when this third argument is included as true, UOX3 will look for the file in the SCRIPTDATADIRECTORY instead of the SHAREDDIRECTORY. Second argument - folderName - is required for this third argument to be used. New syntaxes:
			DeleteFile( fileName )
			DeleteFile( fileName, folderName )
			DeleteFile( fileName, folderName, useScriptDataDir )
	Added new admin command (js/commands/decorate.js) to allow saving/loading world templates. These templates are essentially text files (with .jsdata file extension) that contain the bare minimum amount of details needed to decorate an entire game world, a facet or even a specific area of a facet. The files can be bundled with UOX3 for a smoother first-time-user-experience, can be easily shared with other people as blueprints for world decoration, and they can be saved and loaded on the fly without impacting existing data on a shard. By default, the command will save/load items to/from different files per facet based on the following item categories: doors, signs, lights, moongates, teleporters, misc (everything else).
		Command syntax:
			'decorate save
				Save all items to the default templates, based on each item's objectCategory and facet
			'decorate save [objectCategory]
				Save all items of specified objectCategory, regardless of facet
			'decorate save [facetName]
				Save all items on specified facet, regardless of objectCategory
			'decorate save [customFileName]
				Save all items of all objectCategories on all facets to custom template file
			'decorate save [objectCategory] [facetName]
				Save all items of specified objectCategory in the specified facet
			'decorate save [customFileName] [facetName] x1 y1 x2 y2
				Save all items within specified coordinates on specified facet to customFileName
			'decorate load
				Load all items from the default templates, regardless of objectCategory and facet
			'decorate load [objectCategory]
				Load all items of specified objectCategory, regardless of facet
			'decorate load [facetName]
				Load all items on specified facet, regardless of objectCategory
			'decorate load [customFileName]
				Load all items from file named [customFileName]
			'decorate load [objectCategory] [facetName]
				Load all items of specified objectCategory in the specified facet
			'decorate copy [sourceFacet] [targetFacet]
				Copy all items from one facet to another
			'decorate clean
				Clean up duplicate decorations that might have been loaded/added by accident.
		Note that world templates are by default stored in and read from a subfolder named "worldtemplates" under the new SCRIPTDATADIRECTORY (which defaults to UOX3/js/jsdata/)
	Added welcome gump that is displayed automatically for characters on the admin account (account 0) on first login. This welcome gump gives new shard admins the option to either start with a blank and empty world, or to load the default UOX3 world - based on the default set of world templates provided with UOX3, if any. It also provides a few tips to get started, as well as links to various documentation pages, forum and Discord server. The welcome gump can also be re-opened at a later stage using a new admin command: 'welcome
	Updated Item JS Method Dupe() to support passing NULL instead of a socket, for duplicating items without needing to place them in a player's backpack

11/06/2021 - Xuri
	Added some error-checking to JS function AreaItemFunction() to avoid potential server crash
	Fixed an issue introduced in 0.99.4m, where objects being added to/moved to specific worlds or instances were still visible to players in other worlds/instances
	Fixed issue with loading SCPTRIG tag with value 65535 in older worldfiles, now treats these as if the value was 0
	Updated JS Methods .AddCheckbox() and .AddRadio() to support specifying the gumpImageID to display when button is checked/selected.
		Updated syntaxes:
			.AddCheckbox( topHeight, topLeft, checkImage, defaultStatus, unk2 )
			.AddCheckbox( topHeight, topLeft, checkImageOff, checkImageOn, defaultStatus, unk2 )
			.AddRadio( topHeight, topLeft, radioImage, pressed, id )
			.AddRadio( topHeight, topLeft, radioImageOff, radioImageOn, pressed, id )
	Added new Socket JS Method to close a specific generic gump:
		.CloseGump( gumpID, buttonID ) // gumpID is normally equal to 0xffff + scripttrigger of script gump is created in, while buttonID is the buttonID response we want the client to send when gump closes
	Added new Gump JS Method to end a group of radio buttons started with AddGroup():
		.EndGroup()	// Ends previously started group element
	Re-enabled Gump JS Method MasterGump(), in case someone can use it for something
		.MasterGump( masterGumpID ) // Define master gump of gump?
	Added facet support for 'wipe and 'iwipe commands (js/commands/targeting/wipe.js). Updated syntax:
		'wipe/iwipe
			Brings up target cursors. Wipes all objects in area between target locations, on same facet as user
		'wipe/iwipe x1 y1 x2 y2
			Wipes all objects in specified area, on same facet as user
		'wipe [objType] [facet]
			Wipes all objects of specified type. If facet is specified, wipes only on that facet.
			objTypes: items, multis, boats, npcs, spawners or all
		'wipe all
			Wipes ALL objects, on ALL facets, regardless of object type
		'wipe all force
			Wipes ALL objects, on ALL facets, regardless of object type and whether wipeable flag is set
	Fixed an issue with getTileName() in uox3.cpp that could cause a server crash when fetching the names of certain items

11/06/2021 - Dragon Slayer
	Added thirst system that works similarly to existing hunger system, where characters (and optionally, pets) grow thirsty over time, and gradually draining their stamina (down to a minimum of 1) if too thirsty
	Added new settings to uox.ini under a new [thirst] section to control thirst system:
		THIRSTRATE=6000 	// The rate at which characters grow more thirsty
		THIRSTDRAINVAL=2 	// The amount of stamina drained per thirst cycle when too thirsty
		PETTHIRSTOFFLINE=0 	// Enable/disable whether pets grow more thirsty over time while owners are offline
	Added new JS event that triggers when a character's thirst level changes.
		onThirstChange( pChanging, newStatus )
			Return false or nothing to prevent hard code from running
			Return true to allow hard code to run like normal
	Added new JS properties for Characters related to thirst system (Xuri)
		.thirst 			// Get/Set current thirst level of character
		.thirstRate 		// Get character's thirst rate, based on racial properties or global settings
		.willthirst/ 		// Get/Set whether character will get thirsty
		.tamedThirstRate 	// Get/Set tamed pet's thirst rate
		.thirstWildChance 	// Get/Set tamed pet's chance at going wild if too thirsty
	Updated JS script for drinks (js/server/resource/pitchers.js) to reduce character thirst when consumed, with appropriate system messages displayed based on character's thirst level (Xuri)
	Updated JS commands get (js/commands/targeting/get.js), set (js/commands/targeting/set.js) and tweak (js/commands/targeting/tweak.js) to support getting/setting character hunger levels (Xuri)

04/06/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4p)
	Fixed an issue with return values for onDrop JS event where not all return values would work as intended
	Added -Wno-shift-negative-value flag to CXXFLAGS in Makefile to potentially suppress some JS-related warnings when compiling on Unix platforms (punt)

04/06/2021 - Xuri
	Reverted changes to jsapi.h, which were causing some unwanted behavior
	Fixed some errors reading in UOP files in UOPData.cpp, and made some tweaks to other related files (punt)

04/06/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed an issue that could cause player characters created in older versions of UOX3 to end up with backpacks without max item capacity set, thus being unable to add any items to their backpack
	More warnings cleanup, and some fixes to address size_t differences between Windows and Unix platforms (punt)

03/06/2021 - Xuri
	Cleaned up some warnings caused by 64 bit/32 bit difference between macOS and Windows (punt)

03/06/2021 - Xuri
	Removed RemoveFromSight() from CItem::Update() in cItem.cpp, to address flickering issues with animated items, and for smoother updates of items on boats when sailing.
	Added new flag in CBaseObject - damageable - which determines if an Item or Multi should be considered a damageable object.
	Added new DFN tag for Items and Multis to mark objects as damageable objects
		DAMAGEABLE=0/1 // If enabled, allows client to display healthbar for object, using object's hp/maxhp values as basis. Note that any changes to a damageable object's health will not be reflected in the client until a stat update has been sent.
	Added new JS Property for Items and Multis and Characters to get/set an object's damageable flag
		.isDamageable // 1 or 0
	Added new JS Method for Items, Multis and Characters to force an update of the object's health bar to nearby players:
		.UpdateStats( statType ) // statType can be 0 (Health, only one that works for items), 1 (Mana) or 2 (Stamina)
	Updated DFN entries for training dummies (dfndata/items/houseaddons/house_addons.dfn) to include DAMAGEABLE=1 and HP=100 tags, and also updated script for training dummies (js/item/trainingdummy.js) with some extra features for dummies marked as damageable:
		Show damage numbers over the training dummy when hit
		Update health of training dummy based on damage received when hit

	Updated 'get (js/commands/targeting/get.js) and 'set (js/commands/targeting/set.js) commands to support getting and setting the damageable flag on objects
	Updated updateStats() in uox3.cpp to work with CBaseObject instead of CChar
	Updated statwindow() in CSocket.cpp to work with CBaseObject instead of CChar
	Updated CPUpdateStat in CPacketSend.cpp to work with CBaseObject instead of CChar, to support sending packet 0xA1 to client for Items/Multis

	Fixed an issue with outgoing packet 0x11 where a character's current HP might sometimes incorrectly be displayed as zero
	Updated CPNewObjectInfo in CPacketSend.cpp to send object information packet 0xF3 to client with datatype set to 0x03 for Items/Multis marked as damageable objects, to enable the client's ability to display health-bars for these items.
	Fixed an issue with JS Method for Items - .Refresh() - which previously did nothing, but now instead sends an update of item to all sockets in range

01/06/2021 - Xuri
	Adjustments to source/CMakeList.txt in attempt to fix build issue with CMake
	Updated debug/release configurations for Win32 in VS solution to include required references to zlib

01/06/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4o)
	Added support for MultiCollections.uop. If present in the specified datafolder, this file will be preferred over the traditional multi.mul/idx files, and will enable access to the new multis contained within (punt)
	Added dependency for static library of zlib-1.2.11, of which a minimal version is included in a subfolder alongside spidermonkey in the root UOX3 project folder. This is needed for compression matters related to UOP files and certain UO network packets
	Added VS Solution (zlib.sln) to compile static-library of zlib-1.2.11 for Windows. Makefile for Linux/macOS also included.
	Updated CMakeList.txt to include zlib references

25/05/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4m)
	Fixed a long-standing (20+ years old) issue with objects not being sent/removed consistently when players login, teleport or move around, or when items are being removed, areas wiped, etc.
	Added new class RegionSerialList to store serial references to objects added to/removed from regions (both on worldfile load and when objects move in-game). This allows for faster lookup, insertion tests, etc. and results in worldfiles loading up to ~41% faster
	Fixed an issue where characters in different world instances could shove each-other when moving
	Fixed server crash related to using incorrect argument for REGSPAWN command
	Fixed an issue where characters would not get world changes updated properly in some older (5.x) client versions
	UOX3 will now attempt to resist being closed if a world-save is in progress, to avoid corruption of worldfile data
	Added TryParseJSVal() helper function in cScript.cpp, used to parse jsval values returned from script events. Provides results matching 0 (0, false), 1 (1, true) or any specific int value returned from script.
	JS events updated to use new TryParseJSVal helper function (no change in behaviour):
		onDecay, onResurrect, onCommand, onBuyFromVendor, onSellToVendor, onPickup, onCharDoubleClick, onSkillGump, onUseBandageMacro, onCombatStart, onCombatEnd, onDeathBlow, onBuy, onSell
	JS events with slight change of behaviour after update to use TryParseJSVal:
		onDrop, onDropItemOnItem, onDropItemOnNpc - previously, a blank or non-existent return value would be treated the same as a return true. This will now be treated as a return false. Update scripts accordingly!
	JS events updated to support return values from scripts:
		onCollide, onTalk, onSnooped, OnHungerChange
			Return false or nothing to prevent hard code from running
			Return true to allow hard code to run like normal
		onStolenFrom, onAISliver, onLightChange, onVirtueGumpPress, onQuestGump, onSpecialMove, onSwing, onClick, onHouseCommand, onSellToVendor, onSkillCheck, onSpellGain, onSpellLoss
			Return false to allow hard code and other scripts with event to run like normal
			Return true to prevent hard code and other scripts with event from running
		onSteal
			Return false or nothing to allow hard code and other scripts with event to run like normal
			Return true to prevent hard code and onStolenFrom event from running (theft failed?)
			Return 2 to prevent hard code, but allow onStolenFrom event to run (theft succeeded, but handled in script?)
		onLeaving, onEntrance, onEquip, onUnequip, onEnterEvadeState, onSoldToVendor, onBoughtFromVendor, onSpellSuccess, onSpellTarget, onFlagChange, onDeath
			Return false or nothing to allow other scripts with event to run like normal
			Return true to prevent other scripts with event from running
	Added new JS events that run prior to items being equipped/unequipped, with support for return values:
		onEquipAttempt( pEquipper, iEquipping )
		onUnequipAttempt( pEquipper, iUnequipping )
			Return false or nothing to reject attempt to equip/unequip item, and prevent hard-code or other scripts with event from running
			Return true to allow hard code to run like normal
	Added new JS event that runs prior to onSnooped event, for character doing the snooping:
		onSnoopAttempt( snooped, snooper )
			Return false or nothing to prevent hard code and other snooping-related events from running
			Return true to allow hard code and other snooping-related events to run like normal
	Updated onSnooped JS event to accept return values:
		Return true when success state is true to prevent other scripts with event from running
		Return true when success state is false to prevent hard code and other scripts with event from running
	Added second parameter to onCommand() JS event to match it up with the documented version. New syntax:
		onCommand( socket, cmdString )
	Updated onClick JS event to also run for characters with event attached (return 1 to prevent showing hard-coded name for whatever object is clicked)
	Updated onSteal JS event to include a third parameter, an object reference for the target of the theft
	Fixed an issue where the JS function TriggerEvent() didn't restore the original JSContext and JSObject of the calling script after calling an event in a separate script, causing timers to be associated with the wrong script when both TriggerEvent and StartTimer were used in same script
	Updated KillTimers JS method to support an optional argument specifying the timerID of the timer to be killed. If no arguments are provided, it will - as previously - kill all timers for the object
	Added support for assigning multiple JS scripts per object (item, multi, char, region).
		Any time a scriptID is added to an object, the list of such IDs for that object will be sorted from lowest to highest scriptID, which also determines the execution order for the scripts. Note that if the same JS event is present in several scripts assigned to an object, each of those events will trigger, unless the rules about return values for said event prevent this
	DFNs for Items, Multis, Characters and Regions can now contain multiple SCRIPT=scriptID tags per definition. Each such SCRIPT tag will be applied to the object in question, then sorted from lowest to highest scriptID by server.
	Added new JS property for Items, Multis, Characters and Regions:
		.scriptTriggers 		// If used to get property, will return array object with all script IDs assigned to object. If used to set property, will add script ID to existing list of script IDs for object.
	Modified JS property for Items, Multis, Characters and Regions, which for backwards compatibility functions similar to in older versions:
		.scripttrigger 			// If used to get property, will return last script ID in list of script IDs assigned to object. If used to set property, will clear list of script IDs and assign only the new ID
	Added new JS Methods for Items, Multis, Characters and Regions:
		.AddScriptTrigger( scriptID ) 	// Adds a new scriptID to list of scripts assigned to object
		.RemoveScriptTrigger( scriptID ) // Remove a specific scriptID from object (0 = remove all)
	Removed all traces of SETSCPTRIG and TWEAK commands from source. These commands are now entirely handled in JS.
	Stats and Tweak buttons in list of online characters ('WHOLIST) will now execute the CSTATS or TWEAK command respectively, with target automatically set to character being viewed in list
	Fixed an issue with TWEAK command where items equipped on a character's paperdoll could not be targeted
	Moved SETSCPTRIG command from code to JS (js/commands/targeting/scptrig.js), and supplemented it with some additional commands:
		GETSCPTRIG				// List out all scriptIDs assigned to object
		SETSCPTRIG scriptID 	// Clears list of scriptIDs for object, then assigns the specified scriptID
		ADDSCPTRIG scriptID 	// Adds specified scriptID to list of scriptsIDs assigned to object
		REMOVESCPTRIG scriptID 	// Removes specified scriptID from list of scriptIDs assigned to object (0 = remove all)
	Fixed issue where sub-commands would still execute despite cancelling target cursor when using AREACOMMAND, just without being limited by such pesky things as coordinates (js/commands/targeting/areacommand.js)
	Updated AREACOMMAND to support adding/removing script triggers (js/commands/targeting/areacommand.js)
	Updated CSTATS command to support showing all script triggers attached to an object (js/commands/targetin/gumps.js)
	Updated GET (js/commands/targeting/get.js) and SET (js/commands/targeting/set.js) commands to support adding/removing script triggers from objects
	Updated the following JS scripts to use AddScriptTrigger() method instead of .scripttrigger property:
		kindling script (js/item/kindling.js)
		key script (js/item/key.js)
		pitchers script (js/server/resource/pitchers.js)
		houseSign script (js/server/house/houseSign.js)
		banker script (js/npc/ai/banker.js)
	Fixed some missing/incorrect brackets in the following DFN files (thanks, punt!):
		dfndata/items/gear/armor/base_armors.dfn
		dfndata/items/gear/armor/leather_armor/ninja_leather.dfn
		dfndata/items/skills/misc/misc.dfn
		dfndata/items/building/walls/tent_walls.dfn
		dfndata/items/building/decs/stoneart.dfn

	Updated UOX3 docs to latest version

07/05/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4l)
	Updated LeaveBoat() function to use ValidSpawnLocation() instead of ValidMultiLocation() for more reliable disembarking from boats
	Added support for the following boat commands (and their triggerword aliases):
		raise anchor 		// Raise anchor, allowing boat to move
		drop anchor 		// Drops anchor, preventing boat from moving
		forward one 		// Moves boat one tile forward
		backward one 		// Moves boat one tile backward
		left one 			// Moves boat one tile in port direction
		right one 			// Moves boat one tile in starboard direction
		forward left 		// Moves boat forward left diagonally
		forward right 		// Moves boat forward right diagonally
		backward left 		// Moves boat backward left diagonally
		backward right 		// Moves boat backward right diagonally
		forward left one 	// Moves boat one tile diagonally, forward left
		forward right one 	// Moves boat one tile diagonally, forward right
		backward left one 	// Moves boat one tile diagonally, backward left
		backward right one 	// Moves boat one tile diagonally, backward right
	Added new enum BoatMoveType to keep track of all the additional boat movement types, and changed moveType from UI08 to SI08, in order to use -1 as a representation of an "anchored" and immovable boat
	Boats now start out with anchor dropped when initially placed, and must also have anchor dropped before they can be packed up into model ships, while anchor must be raised in order for tiller man to accept orders to sail
	Added support for two new DFN tags in houses.dfn, primarily for the use of boats/boat holds:
		MAXITEMS=#			// Max items that can be stored in a boat's hold
		WEIGHTMAX=#			// Max weight that a boat's hold can... hold (40000 = 400.00 stones)
	Updated dfndata/house/house.dfn to include default MAXITEMS (125 items) and WEIGHTMAX (400 stones) values for boats
	Fixed an issue where large dragon ships would be spawned with incorrect names due to server assuming they're houses
	Fixed an issue where it was not possible to turn a boat around under certain circumstances
	Tiller men on boats will now be named "a tiller man" if the boat is unnamed, and "The tiller man of [ship name]" if the ship has been named
	Boats now cannot be dry-docked if there are items in the hold
	Boats now cannot be dry-docked if either of the planks are open
	Names of boats are now stored in the title property of ship models, and is used to reapply the boat's name when unpacking the boat, while the ship model itself is named after the boat with a [Dry Docked] tag slapped on at the end.

04/05/2021 - giwo
	Fixed server crash related to JS timers/other tempeffects by replacing the use of CDataList (which uses std::deque) in tempEffects with GenericList (which uses std::list), which is more optimized for removing records in the middle of the array
	Updated Sort() methods in GenericList to use std::list member function sort instead of std::sort (Xuri)
	Applied some code style changes for consistency :art: (Xuri)

03/05/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed an issue where bulletin board posts submitted from client with lines of text longer than 255 bytes were stored with no null-terminator at end of the such lines, since they got cut off in wrong place

	Fixed various issues with in-game bulletin boards; posts can now be made, read and replied to using both regular client and ClassicUO client
	Fixed issue with bulletin board post removal that could cause infinite loops
	Fixed issues with and re-enabled bulletin board maintenance. Should no longer cause infinite loops, nor corrupt bulletin board posts when removing posts marked for deletion! This also fixes NPC escort quests not appearing on bulletin boards after initial quests were accepted and related posts removed.
	Added new GM command in js/commands/msgmod.js:
		'msgmod on/off 		// If on, GMs who open a bulletin board while using ClassicUO client will be able to remove any individual message
	Added additional teleport locations in teleport.scp for Dragon Turtle Spawn area, Khaldun, Terathan Keep, Valley of Eodon, Minax Fortress, Stygian Abyss, Underworld

26/04/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed an issue where 'get command attempts to retrieve incorrect property when isonline parameter is provided
	Fixed an issue where 'set weightmax # would fail because script used an incorrect property name
	Fixed an issue with check for allowed/banned equipment for races; if a list of allowed equipment existed, it would never check the banned list

	Updated a bunch of casts to use UOX3-specific typedefs for consistency
	Startup performance is now faster by an additional 70% over the previous commit, primarily due to modernization of HandleLine() functions in cBaseobject.cpp, cChar.cpp, cItem.cpp and cMultiObj.cpp (punt)

23/04/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4h)
	Exposed a (read-only) JS property for characters to fetch their hunger rate. Uses race's hunger rate if defined, otherwise uses HUNGERRATE form uox.ini:
		.hungerRate 		// Seconds between becoming hungrier
	Updated 'get command to allow retrieving a character's hungerRate property
	Added some details to console during UOX3 startup about which IPs and Ports UOX3 is listening to
	Added new JS event that triggers when a player clicks on the Quest button in the paperdoll. Triggers from character script if present, or global script if not:
		onQuestGump( pUser )
	Added new JS event that triggers when player toggles a special move from a combat book. See packet 0xBF, subCmd 0x19 in packet guides for details on the special moves, whose IDs range from 0x00 to 0x1D:

	Added findNearbyObjects() function to findfuncs.cpp, to find all objects (characters and items) of CBaseObject class near a specified location
	Improved performance when initializing multis on startup; now checks for items near multis, instead of checking for multis near every single item!
	Improved performance when loading items and characters from worldfiles during startup; around 33% faster for release builds, around ~50% faster when running in debug mode through visual studio (punt)

19/04/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4g)
	Completed implementation of onDecay JS event, which was not actually hooked up to anything! Can now be used to interrupt decay for items. Returning false will prevent code from deleting the decaying item, while returning true will continue running the decay code as normal.
	Fixed an issue with .brkPeaceChance JS Character property, which erroneously called on the GetBrkPeaceChanceGain()/SetBrkPeaceChanceGain() functions instead of GetBrkPeaceChance()/SetBrkPeaceChance()
	Fixed issue with loading of UOP map files that was introduced in a previous commit while attempting to get rid of some warnings when compiling UOX3 on Windows!

		.id 				// Account ID (Read-Only)
		.username 			// Account Username (Read-Only)
		.flags 				// Flags set on account (Read-Only)
		.comment 			// Comment/contact info

	Updated 'tweak command to allow viewing and modifying of certain account properties for targeted player characters
		Note that any changes to account properties will not go into effect until a worldsave or manual save of accounts via console has taken place.
	Updated AI for AI_HEALER_G and AI_HEALER_E to check for multi-ownership and line of sight before resurrecting dead players

14/04/2021 - Xuri
	Fixed a casting issue that prevented SEFunctions.cpp from compiling on Linux
	Added additional Region/Townregion JS properties. These (and other properties) can be viewed and modified using the 'tweak command, but changes are not permanently saved and will only be valid as long as the server stays running:
		.id 				// Region ID
		.scripttrigger 		// Script-trigger associated with region
		.numGuards 			// Number of guards associated with town (if any) in region
		.taxes 				// Gold reserves of town (if any) in region
		.reserves 			// Resource reserves for town (if any) in region
		.appearance 		// Appearance - 0 = Spring, 1 = Summer, 2 = Autumn, 3 = Winter, 4 = Desolation, 5 = Unknown
		.music 				// Music assigned to region in regions.dfn
		.weather 			// Weather ID assigned to region in regions.dfn
		.owner 				// Name of owner of guards in the region
	A JS function was added previously, but not mentioned in the changelog:
		GetTownRegion( regionID ) // Takes one parameter, regionID, and returns a region object

13/04/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4f)
	Option to define how much memory JS engine should be allowed to allocate before last-ditch GC kicks in has been moved from engine.dat to a new UOX.INI setting under [system]. Note that too low values can lead to server instability, especially if doing a lot of JS engine reloads, so default value has been increased from 16 to 256 MB per JS Runtime:
		JSENGINESIZE=256 // gcMaxBytes limit in MB per JS Runtime. Must be between 16 and 4095
	Reduced stackchunksize value provided for JS_NewContext from 0x500000 to the recommended default of 8192
	Updated how players are paid for completing NPC escort quests; instead of hard-coded random amount between 0-600 gold, the reward is now based partly on the NPC escort's fame, and partly on the amount of gold the NPC is carrying. The formula for quest rewards thus look like this: rewardAmount = (( totalFame / 100 ) * 50 ) + ( totalGold * 0.25 )
	Fixed healthbars of nearby characters not showing correctly for players who have just logged in. Cause seems to have been UOX3 reading more bytes from network buffer than required when (not) handling packets 0xB5 and 0xFB. Added basic handling of these packets to avoid that problem.
	Fixed an issue where UOX3 would send full status updates (packet 0x11) for each character on the screen, rather than just sending the minimum required for each character. Client doesn't need to know the weight of an NPC, or how much gold an opponent player is carrying!
	Fixed an issue with tooltips for characters and/or items not always appearing, caused by UOX3 not responding correctly to certain tooltip requests (packet 0xD6)

08/04/2021 - Xuri (0.99.4e)

	JS Packet Method GetDWord() now uses JS_NewNumberValue instead of INT_TO_JSVAL to read from the socket buffer, to better handle large numbers, which could previously be returned with wrong values.
	JS Function CalcItemFromSer() now uses a JS_GetStringBytes() and str_value() combo instead of JSVAL_TO_INT() to read the data provided in the function argument. This allows JS scripts to provide item serials to the function directly without needing to split it into four parts first (though that still works)

	Updated some commands to support an alternate STATIC keyword (can also be ommitted) to add base items:
		'add static itemID
		'tile static itemID
	Updated some commands with support for randomization. Provided itemID will be randomized based on provided rndValue:
		/js/commands/targeting/add.js:
			'add itemID rndValue

	Minor updates to various JS scripts
	Fixed issue where some item definitions in dfndata/harditems/harditems.dfn and dfndata/items/building/lighting.dfn used comma instead of space as delimiter for the VALUE tag, which thus never got applied

	Fixed issue where teleporting GM/Counselor to a player's location when responding to a help request would not send map change packet
	Fixed issue where recalling off a recall rune in a different world would not send map change packet
	Fixed issue where using travel menu or 'go place # command would not send map change packet when going to a location in a different world
	When marking recall runes, they will now get a hue reflecting the facet they were marked in (UOX3/js/commands/targeting/magic.js)
	Tooltips for recall runes will now show the name of the facet they were marked in, with facet names being pulled from entries 1975 to 1980 in the dictionary files

	Reduced max attempts at calculating path for NPCs in wanderTypes WT_BOX, WT_CIRCLE or WT_FREE to 25 steps, unless they are evading and attempting to move back into their original wander box/circle
	NPCs who enter "evasion" state because they are unable to find a valid path to an attacker will now have their health reset to maximum, to prevent an exploit to take down any NPCs without risk of taking any damage in return
	JS Methods WalkTo() and RunTo() now actually make use of the provided maxSteps parameter when advanced pathfinding is enabled; previously it would default to 500 steps.
	Added new JS event that triggers when an NPC enters evasion state in combat due to being unable to reach their target

	Fixed a bug where NPC's original npvWander mode could get overwritten if multiple pathfinding actions overlapped

13/11/2020 - Xuri
	Fixed an edge case with 'time command that would not display time correctly (UOX3/js/commands/time.js)

	Fixed an issue with books where server could get stuck in an infinite loop if number of lines per page was higher than 8. Now capped at 8 lines per page.
	Renamed item type enum IT_READABLEBOOK to IT_BOOK, since it's the item type used by both readable and writeable books.
	Changed ANIMALATTACKCHANCE to use a scale of 1 to 1000 instead of 1 to 100, for additional granularity in setting the chance for animals to get attacked by monsters. An INI value of 15 now translates as 1.5% chance (per NPC AI cycle!) instead of the previous 15%

Main guild creation code is still hardcoded, though.
	Removed some unused item types that have been marked as candidates for deletion for over 15 years (IT_CHAOSGATEOPENER, IT_CHAOSGATE, IT_GUILLOTINEANIM, IT_TRAININGDUMMYANIM)!
	Updated UOX3 documentation with complete list of item types, and item layers, in addition to other small additions.

	Added JS function used to find the root container of an item (if any)
		FindRootContainer( itemSerial )
		FindRootContainer( item )
	Added new JS function that allows deleting files from UOX3/shared/ folder or subfolders of shared folder. If no subFolderName is provided, looks for file directly in shared folder itself. Restrictions on file- and folder-names apply.
		bool DeleteFile( fileName, subFolderName )
	Added new JS functions for checking if a specific client or server feature is enabled. See documentation for full list of client/server features.
		GetClientFeature( bitNum ) // Returns true if specified client feature is enabled on server

	Added new DFN tag for items, used by containers to determine item capacity for a given container:
		MAXITEMS=# // 125 is the default for all containers if not set
	Added new JS Item properties:
		.maxItems // gets/sets item capacity for a given container
		.totalItemCount // gets total item count in a container, including sub-containers
	Updated item tooltips for containers to show accurate total item count, as well as to display max item capacity
	Fixed a bug where picking up items from a non-locked down pile of items on the floor inside a multi could cause the remaining pile to be seen as no longer inside the multi, disallowing locking it back down and causing it to decay based on regular decay timer instead of house-specific one
	Updated JS command set to allow setting poison-level on items ('set poison #) and hunger-level on characters ('set hunger #)
	Fixed an issue with js/item/food.js that prevented poisoned food from poisoning characters when eaten
	Fixed an issue with js/skill/poisoning.js that prevented players from poisoning food!
	Updated various JS scripts and hardcoded targeting functions to disallow the targeting of locked down resources using skills and tools
	Updated JS Method TextMessage() to support three extra, optional parameters. Note that if one optional parameter is included, all preceding optional parameters are also required!

05/10/2020 - Xuri
	Updated JS item properties MORE, MOREX, MOREY, MOREZ and SERIAL, and character property SERIAL, to pass values to JS scripts using JS_NewNumberValue() instead of INT_TO_JSVAL if the property value cannot fit inside JSVAL (checked with INT_FITS_IN_JSVAL)
	Added support in CResponse.cpp for client trigger word for securing containers in houses - TW_HOUSESECURE
	Updated CMulHandler::CheckStaticFlag() to match with statics that cover/extend across the specified Z coordinate, not just ones that have the same base Z level
	Updated CMulHandler::DoesMapBlock() to not deem map tiles as blocking if they are more than 16 Z (height of a character) higher than the specified Z coordinate to check
	Exposed method for finding corners of a multi to JS engine:
		.GetMultiCorner( cornerID ) - Gets coordinates for specified corner of multi (0 = NW, 1 = NE, 2 = SW, 3 = SE)
	Exposed various functions related to map, statics and multis to JS engine:
		CalcMultiFromSer( serial ) - Find a multi from a provided serial
		GetMapElevation( x, y, z, world) - Returns the map elevation at specified coordinates
		IsInBuilding( x, y, z, world, instance, checkHeight ) - Returns true if the specified location is inside a static building (underneath static items), or if player is inside a multi. If the checkHeight argument is true, player is only deemed inside a multi if there are multi-items above the player's head. If player is in a courtyard/on a rooftop, they will be deemed to be NOT in the building. checkHeight is not used for the static part of the function.
		CheckStaticFlag( x, y, z, world, tileFlagID ) - Checks to see if any statics at given coordinates has specified tile flag
		DoesStaticBlock( x, y, z, world, checkWater ) - Checks if statics at/above given location blocks characters

05/10/2020 - Xuri
	Updated warning messages printed in UOX3 when attempting to inherit an invalid/non-existent item or character script entry using the GET tag, to also include the name of the script entry being inherited
	Added new tag for ore types in skills.dfn that determines default chance of finding a particular ore (can be overridden via OREPREFS tag in regions.dfn):
		ORECHANCE - takes a value from 0 to 1000, where 1000 equals 100.0%
	Added default ORECHANCE values for each ore type in skills.dfn, based on estimated chance of finding these ore types around the era of Publish 15/16 in Official UO
	OREPREFS tag in regions.dfn now uses [sectionName] of ore type from skills.dfn instead of actual name of the ore
	OREPREFS tag in regions.dfn now uses comma as separator instead of space. New syntax: OREPREFS=[oreType,oreChance]

	Added functionality to return different amount of ingots when smelting ore, based on the size of ore being melted
	Fixed a bug introduced in 0.99.3 that would set invalid values for certain properties on newly created items and NPCs if the tag for that property in the DFNs accepted random values, but only supplied one value. Example: Amount=1, vs Amount=10 20. As part of the fix for this, added sanity checking for all item and character DFN tags that accept two values.
	Fixed weapon damage not appearing in status gump
	Fixed a spidermonkey compilation issue with xcode 12.0.1/Apple clang v 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.2) (punt)

	Improved AmbientFootsteps feature so footstep sounds are played more in tune with character movement
	AmbientFootsteps now also play for NPC movement
	Changed how code handles randomizing between MINTIME and MAXTIME values from region spawners; now multiplies values by 60 (to get seconds) before randomizing, instead of after, to make use of full range of seconds between the values (which are in minutes)
	Adjusted default global NPC movement speeds in [speedup} section of uox.ini to use less extreme values
	Added a DEBUGMOVEMULTIPLIER define in cChar.cpp used to multiply NPC movement delays by the specified value (1.75 by default) when running UOX3 in debug mode, due to reduced server performance in debug mode
	Documentation updates:
		Added section on DFN tags for Character, Item, Region, SpawnRegion and Weather DFNs.

	Added optimization flag -O2 for release build in CMakeLists.txt in project root (Xuri)
	Added StringUtility file with general common string manipulation functions (punt)
	Updated RandomNum function to use a "seedless" random number generator from C++11 instead of the old C rand() function. (punt)
	Overall code cleanup to remove/replace platform-dependent code (punt)
	Replaced potentially unsafe usage of C string stuff like sprintf, vsprintf, vsnprintf, strncat, strcpy and strlen throughout the code with calls to a format() function containing only a single, safe use of vsnprintf, ensuring there's a single place of failure if there's anything to fix and and making it easy to potentially replace this with std::format from C++20 when the time comes. (punt)
	Replaced usage of char in many places with std::string (punt)
	Started process of replacing UString usage with functions provided through StringUtility instead (punt)

	Fixed a issue in JS/COMMANDS/TARGETING/add.js that would display 'undefined' in system message when adding raw/base items
	Updated default jail time in JS/COMMANDS/TARGETING/jail.js (and in code) from 100000 seconds to 86400 seconds (24 hours)
	All references in code and scripts to "midi" changed to "music", to reflect fact that modern clients don't actually even have midi files. This change covers both GM commands, DFN tags in regions.dfn and JS methods/properties.
	Added new socket property for storing temporary int in JS - tempInt2
	Added new socket property for storing temporary object in JS - tempObj2
	Expanded XGO command in JS/COMMANDS/TARGETING/x.js to support optional world and instance parameters
	Fixed an issue that prevented characters from vanishing from the the sight of players when teleporting to a different instance
	Added support for ClassicUO client's WorldMap tracking packet (0xf0) for guildmembers/partymembers. This is the same packet as Razor uses for feature negotiation, so merged the handling of those two packets together into CPIKrriosClientSpecial, which can also be extended to handle other uses of this packet.
	Added new UOX.INI setting  whether shard should respond to ClassicUO client's WorldMap tracking packets for guildmembers/partymembers
		CLASSICUOMAPTRACKER=0

21/08/2020 - Xuri (0.99.2o)
	Added support (UOPInterface.cpp/hpp) for loading map files in UOP format, allowing UOX3 to use
		map files from clients up to at least v7.0.86.2 without requiring files to be converted to
		mul format first. Loading of UOP files is slower than for equivalent mul files, but after
		startup, the performance of lookups remains the same for both (punt)
	Updated TWEAK, INFO in code and ISTATS, CSTATS in gumps.js to display 4-digit hex-ids for IDs
		consistently in the format of 0x####
	Fixed issue that would disconnect ClassicUO users if they used WorldMap feature in the client,
		via CPIKrriosClientSpecial() handler in CPacketReceive.cpp/h, which will handle all things
		packet 0xF0. As of yet it doesn't respond correctly to the WorldMap-related version of the
		packet, but at least it no longer disconnects this client from the server.

15/08/2020 - Xuri
	Updated healing.js to disallow usage of healing skill if target is in a house/multi not owned by either healer or healee
	Fixed broken starting locations in UOX.INI

14/08/2020 - Xuri (0.99.2n)
	Replaced platform specific ways of looking up and loading DFN files in cServerDefinitions.cpp with a common, cross-platform method using std::filesystem. This also fixes an issue with loading of map0.mul on Linux when maps.4xclients.old is present in dfndata/maps/ directory (thanks, punt!)

13/08/2020 - Xuri
	Misc changes to address errors and warnings when compiling on 64bit Linux
		%li changed to %i
		%lu changed to %u
		Some (SERIAL) changed to (UI64)
		Some size_t changed to UI32

12/08/2020 - Xuri
	Embraced the usage of R32, R64, SI16, UI16, SI32, UI32, SI64 and UI64 typedef aliases as replacement for built-in types throughout the sourcecode:
		typedef float				R32;
		typedef double				R64;
		typedef signed char			SI08;
		typedef unsigned char		UI08;
		typedef signed short int	SI16;
		typedef unsigned short int	UI16;
		typedef signed int			SI32;
		typedef unsigned int		UI32;
		typedef signed long long	SI64;
		typedef unsigned long long	UI64;
	As part of this process, UI32 was redefined from unsigned long int to unsigned int, and SI32 from signed long int to signed int to ensure the size of variables using these remain the same (32bit) across both Windows, Linux and MacOS for both 32bit and 64bit platforms
	Replaced instances of toLong() with toInt(), and toULong() to toUInt()
	Replaced instances of "long" and "int" with SI32 where possible
	Replaced instances of "unsigned long" and "unsigned int" with UI32 where possible
	Replaced instances of "float" with R32 where possible

	Updated dictionary files with new entry about blocking attacks using parrying skill
	Fixed placing a house addon teleporting player to the location of the addon
	Added support for TELEPORT tag to regions.dfn. If set to 0, use of the Teleport spell is not allowed in a given region. Defaults to 1 if not specified.

	Fixed issue where the wrong GFX would be displayed for Field-spells aligned north/south
	Fixed issue where NPCs without fencing or swordsmanship would not be allowed to poison anyone in combat. Tough luck, spiders!
	Fixed issue with some NPCs using invalid values for POISONSTRENGTH. The valid range of poisons goes from 1 (weak) to 4 (deadly).
	Added three new sections to DFNDATA/NEWBIE/newbie.dfn - [DEFAULT ELF MALE], [DEFAULT ELF FEMALE] and [DEFAULT ALL]
	Added item and character-direction to ISTATS and CSTATS commands in JS/COMMANDS/TARGETING/gumps.js
	Fixed an issue where containers with specific MORE values were interpreted as being trapped. Trapped containers now use MOREZ instead of MORE.
	Fixed some issues with boat-movement (drifting/turning left/right, in particular) being blocked in cases where it shouldn't be
	Fixed an issue where boat-commands to drift left/right could be spammed to move boat at high speeds. Now limited to normal boat speed multiplied by 1.5
	Fixed an issue where static water tiles would block placement of boats
	Fixed Tillerman-location on large ships turned southwards

	Nearby pets will now teleport along with their owner into/onto houses/boats when those are placed
	Fixed some cases in JS/MAGIC/clumsy.js where it tried to send sysmessages through sockets, to NPCs - who have no such thing
	Added torches to ProvisionerShopping shoplist in DFNDATA/ITEMS/shoplist.dfn
	Moved TurnTorward() method in JS/ITEM/axe.js to after the area resource-check, so player only turns if there is chopping to be done
	Reduced chance of creature-sounds playing slightly. The more creatures, the higher the chance a sound will play.
	Parts of movement code rewritten to solve Z-related issues (xantier)
	Fixed various other issues with the walking-code
	Removed hacky workaround for bug with NPC pathfinding leading to queues of NPCs all lined up, replaced by proper pathfinding
	Made some tweaks to various parts of the NPC pathfinding code
		Reduced default maxSteps variable in advanced pathfinding routine from 1000 steps to 500 steps for performance reasons
			The maxSteps variable will also increase/decrease depending on the type of movement the pathfinding is for
		Added a safeguard against NPCs repeatedly failing at advanced pathfinding and slowing down the server as a result. Now resets their NPCWANDERMODE on critical failures.
		Added an internal counter for NPCs called "failPath", which increases whenever the NPC is blocked from moving when server thinks it has a valid path.
			Once it reaches a certain threshold, NPC can push past a blocking character, or alternatively stop whatever it's doing (fleeing, following, etc).
		Advanced Pathfinding will now take into account characters blocking the way when generating valid paths - no more queued up NPCs in long lines!
		Enabled pathfinding in water for water-walking creatures
		NPCs that fail to pathfind while fleeing will abort fleeing and re-engage their opponent in combat
		NPCs that fail to pathfind while in combat will abort combat and enter a state of "evasion" for a short time, during which
			...Other characters wont block their movement
			...They can't be attacked
			...They won't attack anyone
			...They'll try to move back to their bounding box, if they have one
	Added some randomization in how NPCs pick their targets in combat, so not all NPCs pick the same target at the same time
	MAX_VISRANGE and DEFSOCK_RANGE increased from 15 to 18 to better deal with item-updates in higher-resolution clients
	JS events OnDeathBlow and OnDispel can now be used to override death and/or dispelling of summoned creatures (and magical fields), by returning false from the script
		Note that for OnDeathBlow overriding code means that things like fame/karma-calculations and criminal/murderer-flags and timers need to be manually set in the script
	Improvements to LineOfSight-code:
		LoS no longer checks against a hardcoded list of items, but instead uses tiledata-flags (missing flags can be overriden through tiles.dfn)
		LoS-checks will no longer be done for NPCs against targets that have visible status VT_PERMHIDDEN or VT_GHOSTHIDDED
		LoS-checks should now work more consistently - no more NPCs aggroing players through walls! (Eolirin)
			Note that this also has a benefit for server performance, as less aggroing NPCs mean less unneccesary attempts at NPC pathfinding!
	Fixed incorrect offset on upstairs door in 2-story villa in DFNDATA/HOUSE/house.dfn
	Added house-deed for Farmer's Cabin, and added this to the house-deeds itemmenu (DFNDATA\HOUSE\house.dfn and DFNDATA\ITEMS\ItemMenu.bulk.dfn)

	Added support for the SA-specific map (map5.mul - Termur) to DFNDATA/MAPS/maps.dfn
	Added support for extended itemIDs (0x3FFF to 0xFFFF) used in SA and HS clients. Maximum supported depends on size of tiledata run on the server.
	Added support for reading new versions of tiledata.mul and multi.mul. No settings needed, version-handling taken care of automatically.
	Added support for New Object Information packet (0xF3) via CPNewObjectInfo packet class.
		This replaces packet 0x1A in client-versions 7.0+, and enables displaying items and multis with IDs extending beyond 0x3FFF
	Added support for packet 0xD7, SubCommand 0x28 - Guild button on paperdoll, which gives access to guild-functions if character belongs to a guild.
		Can be enabled/disabled through UOX.INI setting PAPERDOLLGUILDBUTTON=0/1. Defaults to 0.

	Updated packet 0xA9 (Character List/Starting Locations) with UO:SA and UO:HS-specific handling.
	Updated packet 0x24 (Draw Container, from 7 to 9 bytes) to support Container Type-flag in UO:HS clients, to ensure that containers, spellbooks and vendors continue working.
	Changed the upper limit for the amount of stamina that can contribute to faster attack-speeds (for NPCs only) from 100 to 300
		This increases their maximum theoretical attack-speed from attacking every 1.5 seconds to roughly every 0.75 seconds
	Fixed incorrect Meditation skill-entry for lich NPCs (DFNDATA\NPC\undead.dfn) - was set to max 9500 (950.0), should have been 950 (95.0)
	Earthquake-spells will no longer affect mounted targets, animation-wise
	Added new UOX.INI option to determine whether attack-speed bonuses are gained from Stamina (default) or Dexterity: ATTACKSPEEDFROMSTAMINA=1/0
	Added new UOX.INI option to control the displaying of damage-numbers in combat (previously used DISPLAYHITMSG for numbers too): DISPLAYDAMAGENUMBERS=1/0
	Implemented better support for Yell (1.5 * normal speech distance) and Whisper (1 tile distance for players, 3 for GMs)
	Whispering will no longer take hidden players out of hiding
	Normal players can no longer see regular speech from permanently hidden GMs or Counselors
	Normal players can see whispers from permanently hidden GMs or Counselors, if they're within distance (3 tiles)
	Added a new section to UOX.INI - [clientsupport] - along with the following settings to determine approved client-versions for the server:
		CLIENTSUPPORT4000=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT5000=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT6000=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT6050=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT7000=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT7090=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT70160=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT70240=0/1
		NOTE: Each of these settings represent a range of clients, not just the individual versions mentioned. This means that CLIENTSUPPORT4000, for instance,
		 will allow or disallow connections from clients 4.0.0 to 4.0.11f. Also note that while it is possible to enable support for all clients at the same time,
		 it highly recommended to restrict support for client versions that match up to what the server is running.
	Fixed various issues with the skill-gump (crashes) and skill-locks (not working/showing weird gumps instead of arrows/lock)
	Added new UOX.INI option: EXTENDEDSTARTINGSTATS=0/1
		If enabled, makes new characters start with 90 statpoints (selectable in clients 7.0.16.0+ only, lower versions only get 90 if using templates) instead of 80.
	Added new UOX.INI option: EXTENDEDSTARTINGSKILLS=0/1
		If enabled, allows for four starting skills (selectable in clients 7.0.16.0+ only, lower versions only get 4th skill if using templates) instead of three

		onSell( socket, objVendor ) - triggers for vendor before tradegump is opened. Can be used to restrict vendor access.
		onBuyFromVendor(socket, objVendor, objBought ) - triggers for item while item is being bought from an NPC vendor; return false in script to block sale, defaults to true

			SI16 CalcSpellDamageMod( CChar *caster, CChar *target, SI16 baseDamage, bool spellResisted )
		Updated cMagic::CheckResist() with magic resistance formulas based on pre-AoS information
		Added BASEDMG tag to a number of spells in DFNDATA/SPELLS/spells.dfn.
			For damage-spells, it's the maximum potential basedamage done before bonuses (or penalties) based on target resist, caster eval int and item resistances.
			For healing spells, it's the maximum potential basehealing done before potential bonuses
		Damage-spells updated to use new methods for calculating damage and magic resistances, both of which should now be close to pre-AoS implementation
		Changed Chain Lightning and Meteor Swarm spells to split the total damage done between all targets
		Mind Blast changes:
			Mind Blast will now never exceed 60% of target max-health, nor above 120% of BASEDMG
			If target's Int stat makes out a larger percentage of his/her total stats (Sum of Str, Dex, Int) than the caster's, spell backfires onto caster

	Changed CChar::Damage() to handle armor and resistance effects, it also handles the repsys,
	peace breaking, elemental weakness, displays the damage, creates a reaction if an attacker
	is given and calls CChar::Die() if the hp drop below 1. It takes the following values:
		SI16 damageValue	- The amount of damage to be done.
		CChar *attacker		- The char that caused the damage.
		bool doRepsys		- Do reputation handling (criminal, murderer, karma and fame).
		WeatherType damageType	- The type of damage, use NONE to ignore armor/resistance, use
					  PHYSICAL to use normal armor, anything above is elemental damage.

					  calculate the hit location.

13th March, 2006 - Maarc
	Altered the CBO resistances code to use an array rather than a number of variables

	This could easily change in future, with people wanting to use other elemental stuff
	Adjusted CItem::CopyData() so that it copies all the WeatherDamage values instead of only a couple
	Upgraded the container size on weatherBools, as the number of weather entries has moved beyond a UI08 size

3/13/2006 - grimson

	the players backpack until they have their final ID, to prevent the adding of wrong weight

				   Note for players char the settings from the uox.ini apply if
				   there are no settings specified for the race.

		Re-activated the pet-hunger system. Pets will now become hungry and upon starving
		there is a configurable chance that they may become wild again. Note: Pets won't
		die from hunger and their hunger value is reset after becoming wild again. The
		hunger rate and the chance to become wild again can be configured by a new tag:
			TAMEDHUNGER=# # the first value is the hunger rate, the second the chance in %
					of the pet becoming wild again. Note: The values are seperated
					with a space instead of a comma on this tag.
		To feed a pet just drag some food on it, currently all types of food work.

		There is also another new DFN tag:
			WILLHUNGER=# if this is set to 0 the NPC will not suffer from any type of hunger.

	Added a the possibility that a char gets hit by a lightning during a storm,
	this is controlled by the LIGHTNINGAFFECT, LIGHTNINGDAMAGE and LIGHTNINGCHANCE
	settings in races.dfn.
	Added storm to the IsRaceWeakToWeather() JS function.

2/17/2006 - grimson
	Fixed some bugs in calculating the heat/cold damage in doWeatherEffect().
	Rain now lowers the current temperature by 5, a storm by 10.
	Moved the sending of the light level and weather status from startChar() into
	CChar::Teleport() by adding a force forceUpdateLight option to checkRegion().

2/17/2006 - grimson (0.98-3.3k [3.4 BETA])
	Added cMapStuff::inBuilding() function to determine wheter a given set of coordinates
	is inside a building. I does this by checking whether there is a static or multi above
	the coordinates.
	Added inBuilding() and SetInBuilding() functions to CChar and set it on movement and
	teleport.
	Use the new inBuilding() function to stop/start weather effects as soon as a player
	enters or leaves a building.
	Send the light level and weather status directly after a player log's in.

2/16/2006 - grimson
	Changed cWeatherAb::DoPlayerStuff() to reset weather effect timers if needed.

2/16/2006 - grimson (0.98-3.3j [3.4 BETA])
	Fixed VC6 build errors (thanks to giwo).
	Wrote all available race settings into the header of races.dfn and documented a few of them.
	Rewrote parts of the weather system:
		Added weather type storm.
		Heat wave and cold snap are calculated once per uo day and set the temperature to a fixed value
		between MAXTEMP and HEATINTENSITY resp. COLDINTENSITY and MINTEMP.
		Storm, Snow and Rain are calculated oncer per uo hour.
		Rewrote doWeatherEffect() to better seperate the different weather effects and to change the way
		they are calculated.
		Added new settings to races.dfn:
			HEATLEVEL - Sets the minimum heat at which the race get's damaged.
			COLDLEVEL - Sets the minimum cold at which the race get's damaged.
			STORMAFFECT - Defines if the race is affected by a storm
			STORMDAMAGE - Defines the damage a race takes from storm
			STORMSECS - Defines the interval at which the races takes damage from a storm.

16th February, 2006 - Maarc (0.98-3.3i [3.4 BETA])
	Committed some fixes to giwo's last commit (missed some changes in cScript.cpp that was blocking people from compiling)
	Removed a lot of commented stuff.  Dead code that's not used any more and things like that have been reduced
	Begun damage/healing tracking support.  All places in C++ code should be covered (will need to update JS engine).  Healing
	 and damage is now tracked per character, so that they can find out who has damaged/healed them the most.  If healing/damage
	 hasn't occurred in the past 5 minutes, they get taken off the list
	An offshoot of the damage tracking stuff is a change to combat.  Fame/karma/kills has been moved into CBaseObject, because in
	 future, we'll look at tracking fame/karma/kills updates for weapons and armour (so if you kill repeatedly with a sword, the
	 sword's kill count increases)
	Much of the fame/karma/kills stuff isn't done, and currently, we don't take advantage of the damage tracking.  Future
	 progressive updates will help with karma/fame parcelling on death, and to help NPCs make smarter decisions in combat
	Broke out packet 0xBF into a CPI class of it's own.  Rather than making it a huge monolithic class, it internally hands it
	 off to other packet handling classes


2/15/2006 - giwo (0.98-3.3h [3.4 BETA])
	Marked StringToNum(), NumToString(), NumToHexString() for later deletion, please use built-in JS method .toString() and function parseInt() in their place.

2/12/2006 - giwo (0.98-3.3b [3.4 BETA])
	Modified DFN reloading so it reloads teleport.scp as well.

	by using the FirstItem()/NextItem()/FinishedItems() syntax.

2/12/2006 - grimson
	Added two new JS functions:
	FindItem( x, y, z, world, id) - returns the item with the "id" that is on the
	"z" level and closest to the coordinates of x and y. Or NULL if no item is found.
	GetItem( x, y, z, world) - returns the item that is on the given coordinates or

2/11/2006 - grimson
	Updated the CPUpdateStat function to use the GetMaxHP, GetMaxStam and GetMaxMana
	for sending the respective values instead of sending the strenght, dexterity and
	intelligence values.

2/11/2006 - giwo (0.98-3.3)
	Added 'set DEF (items), ARMOR (chars), and LAYER (items) commands.

	Made some changes to the enumeration JSObjectType, because gcc 3.3.5 was chucking a wobbly over some code
	Changed a call to _strnicmp to strnicmp to deal with a linux compile error - note, we probably don't want to use such things anyway ... convert both strings to a UString, lower() them, and compare the subsets requested?

	Fixed an issue causing the server to randomly crash when sailing for prolonged periods of time.
	Removed an extra RemoveFromSight() packet sent upon item deletion.

	Hungercheck for players should now be working again (Grimson)

26th January, 2006 - Maarc
	Fixed a bug with clumsy JS (visibility not resetting properly)
	Added JS implementation for heal and feeblemind
	Added JS implementation for magic arrow, but it relies on MagicDamage(), which is not completely implementable (missing Karma, Fame and CPDisplayDamage)
	Added a ValidateObject() function to the JS engine, that behaves the same as it does in the C++ code
	Updated 'set command to support setting of health (via health or hp)
	NOTE: Tweak seems to be broken (the buttons don't fire anything), and I have no idea why
	NOTE: Heal is currently a vampiric heal (some health is subtracted from the caster to heal the target).  This is *not* a new behaviour.
	NOTE: Tweaked up magic arrow damage (a GM mage was doing less than 4 damage every time).
	Old magic arrow formula
		baseDamage	= 2 + Random( 0, 1 )
		mageryMult	= (Magery / 2000) + 1 (maximum multiplier, 1.5)
		Damage Dealt	= baseDamage * mageryMult - EvalIntCheck

	New magic arrow formula (JS Only!)
		baseDamage	= 2 + Random( 0, 5 )
		mageryMult	= (Magery / 2000) + 1
		DamageDealt	= baseDamage * mageryMult - EvalIntCheck

	The EvalInt check has changed, as well (with the JS code, not the C++ code.  All non-JS spells still adhere to this old standard).
	Previously, a successful check would always draw off a fixed amount of damage ( 10% of your skill level )
	Adjusted the JS socket property for characters, so that it returns an explicit NULL object if there is no socket attached
	NOTE: Researching into JSExtendedClass instead of JSClass, so that we can implement equality testing (like, attacker != caster sorts of things)


25th January, 2006 - Maarc
	Moved checkkey(), processkey() and cl_getch() from uox3.cpp into CConsole methods
	Added a key/command handler console exposure to the JS environment (involves a secondary runtime because of threading!)
	Note: Creating/editing world objects through this environment is not thread safe, and may cause errors
	Modified Console.PrintDone() and Console.PrintFailed() to take an optional boolean parameter as to whether it is printed instantly, or queued up
	Added functions Console.BeginShutdown() and Console.Reload( intVal )
		BeginShutdown() takes no parameters
		Reload() takes a single parameter, with the values of
			0	Reload INI
			1	Reload Accounts
			2	Reload Regions
			3	Reload Spawn Regions
			4	Reload Spells
			5	Reload Commands
			6	Reload Definition Files
			7	Reload JS
			8	Reload HTML
	Included an example script that takes the old 1->9 keys and implements them through the new JS routines
	Included an example script that takes the old shutdown keys and implements them through the JS routines
	Couple of prettying up with the loading code and what it displays

22nd January, 2006 - Maarc
	Added a P_TIMESTAMP define to Config.h, for timestamping packet logs (through the use of RealTime)
	Removed unnecessary defines from Config.h
	Fixed a typo or two
	Removed some debug code I committed by accident
	Our packet logs were generating 7 column data, not 8!
	Updated some packet notes + code (0xA9 and 0xB9 packets) to deal with elves stuff (based on http://www.uox3.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=748&highlight= )
	Updated CPCharAndStartLoc to log a few more flags
	Added a detailed Log routine to CPEnableClientFeatures
	Moved Capped() in pcmanage.cpp to higher upwards
	Changed CPICreateCharacter::Log to dump out hex values for body/skin colours
	Added some preliminary support for elvish bodies
	Needs doing: Adding random names list 3 (elf male) and 4 (elf female) for incognito
	Updated gender IDs 0 == human male, 1 == human female (as before).  2 == elf male, 3 == elf female, 0xFF == unknown.  Potentially has JS impacts! (Gender property)
	Note: Need to experiment with gender values with CPStatWindow (see code notes)
	Note: isHuman() doesn't even evaluate current dead bodies, what is the impact?
	Renamed validHair() to validHairStyle() because we want to validate colour as well
	Added a CanSee() routine to JS based socket and character objects.  Syntax is as follows
		sourceObject.CanSee( otherObject );
		sourceObject.CanSee( targX, targY, targZ );

		otherObject can be either a character, item or socket.  If they're not on the same world or the target item is in a container, line of sight fails.
	Proper validation of hair style on creation of elvish characters

21st January, 2006 - Maarc
	Fixed an Alignment issue in dumping out CPCharAndStartLoc (converting tabs to explicit spaces)
	Turned out last byte of the packet as a real number, rather than a UI08 which is interpreting as a char
	Updated some packet notes from what I could scrounge through the net
	Added basic CPIMetrics class to read in the 0xD9 packet that gets sent
	Fixed a logging issue with CPCharAndStartLoc that wasn't taking the extra characters into account
	Fixed a logging issue with CPCharAndStartLoc that was trying to dump out location details as ASCII codes, not as strings
	Added a feature to packet logging so that it will fill a line of less than 8 bytes to 8 bytes, to even out it's display
	CPISecondLogin logging claimed to be packet 0x80, when in reality, it's 0x91
	Unknown byte in CPIFirstLogin now displayed numerically, rather than as a dodgy ASCII char
	Changed Seed IP of CPRelay to 0xFFFFFFFF
	Moved pSplit() and PackShort() from CPacketSend.cpp to CPacketReceive.cpp, given that's the only place that it is even used
	Removed some unnecessary dead code

1/20/2006 - Xuri
	Yumi-bows should now use arrows instead of crossbow bolts.

	Removed call to StoreRandomItemValue() in CMultiObj::LoadRemnants() - not really necessary, and the function call needs to be after world load, not during (ie candidate for PostLoad, if any)

	Uncommented PORT functionality in source. This is the port in which UOX3 will listen on, it is wrong to assume that the port
	 listed on the first server list line in the ini file is correct. In almost ALL cases they would be the same however what if

8/1/2004 - giwo
	Changed some variable sizes in order to reduce type mismatches and memory waste.
	Created a new class, CDataList, this is basically a safe wrapper for deque, where one can specify what they are storing.
	This allows us to consolidate quite a bit of code from several different classes by simply making our lists CDataList< objtype * >
	rather than using DCHARLIST or DITEMLIST, etc.

	Old style listings:
	------------------
private:
	DCHARLIST chars;
	DITEMLIST items;
	DCHARLIST_ITERATOR charsIter;
	DITEMLIST_ITERATOR itemsIter;
public:
	FirstChar();
	NextChar();
	FinishedChars();
	NumChars();

	FirstItem();
	NextItem();
	FinishedItems();
	NumItems();

	AddChar();
	RemoveChar();

	AddItem();
	RemoveItem();
	------------------

	New Style:
	------------------
public:
	CDataList< CChar * >	chars;
	CDataList< CItem * >	items;
	------------------

	Everything else is handled internally (and thus any bugs that arise can be fixed in one place, not half a dozen).

	JS Changes:
		New character prop: magicReflect, sets and returns if they have magic reflect on
		New character methods:
			SpellMoveEffect( target, spell )
			SpellStaticEffect( spell )
			BreakConcentration( [socket] )
		Wrote clumsy.js, the first UOX3 spell to be put in JS. This script is mostly working, but there are
		some issues that need to be worked out before the entire spell system is put out to the JS engine.

		Currently known issues:
			No way to cause one target to attack another in JS.
			No Line of Sight checks in JS.

August 2 2004
	Changed __unix__ references to UOX_PLATFORM != PLATFORM_WIN32

July 31 2004

	Wrote a console test driver script (command consoletest)
	Posix compliance fix from xir
	Added MSVC7.1 project files

July 29 2004
	Note: We need to change references to __unix__ to something more like UOX_PLATFORM != PLATFORM_WINDOWS or UOX_PLATFORM == PLATFORM_LINUX
	Some of che's fixes were not fixes (ie commenting out the throws) or improperly done (platform specific decls don't go in uox3.h)

7/28/2004 - giwo
	Minor fixes, cleanups

			"CHARACTER" 	= OT_CHAR
			"ITEM" 		= OT_ITEM
			"SPAWNER" 	= OT_SPAWNER

	Bug fix on command_darklight (Xuri)
	Altered the ACCOUNTSBLOCK code so that it uses proper constructor rather than assignment (double assignment, essentially)
	Removed some unused properties of accounts (bPackPacket)


7/12/2004 - giwo
	Added 'FIXSPAWN command to update all item spawners in the world to work with CSpawnItem.
	Minor changes.

7/11/2004 - giwo
	Fully implemented CSpawnItem, removing remnants of old spawners.
	(Note this will break any current spawn items you have in your world, sorry for the inconvenience).
	Broke cBaseObject::Dupe() into two functions, Dupe() and CopyData() to allow carrying over cBO settings
		to the Duped item and make way for future sub-classes of CItem and CChar.
	Modified townregions to now store an npclist to pull guards from and the total amount of guards to spawn.
	Updated the CommandList docs with the latest changes to the command list.
	Minor consolidations and modifications to the scripts.
		Removed /tracking/ and /polymorph/ moving their scripts into /menus/.

	Added a few more dictionary entries.

09 July 2004 - Maarc
------------
	Completely switched over to ObjectFactory code, getting rid of the other stuff - think its best for debugging
	Fixed a bug with 'make gm, we were trying to sprintf a std::string
	Removed periodic trigger code, as it never has a chance to load or activate, and needs a rethink (more like commands or spells?)

08 July 2004 - Maarc
------------
	Changed the saving of Damage property, we read it in as lo,hi and write it as hi,lo - now consistent
	Found the non-disappearing horse bug on mounting.... Teleport() does a RemoveFromSight, but by THAT time, we've already... gone :)
		2 possible fixes
			1) Store the old location so it can be used on RemoveFromSight
			2) Tell *everyone* about it
		For the moment, I have elected the former until we can decide on a better strategy, as the implementation does get a bit hairy
	Implementation was missing for Delete() for CItem and CChar under ObjectFactory mode - by implementing this, wipe works again, amongst other things.

7/7/2004 - giwo
	Consolidated all the more's in CItem into a single tempVars[] array.
	Once again implemented deques in SubRegions and fixed some issues with list corruption.
	Implemented deques in CItem to avoid corruption in Containers
	Added CObjectHandler class to replace need for hash tables to map serials to indexes.
	Fixed some possible issues with cSpawnRegions.
	Fixed an issue causing some crashes involving speech.
	Further implementation of CSpawnItem.
	Fixed many areas where a hex value did not have the 0x infront of it.
	Modified CreateDFNItem() and CreateBlankItem(), now accepts specification of the objecttype (defaults to normal item).
	Modified a few of the targeting functions to make way for adding spawner items.

07 July 2004 - Maarc
------------
	JS related fixes
		"scrollLow" property of Spell objects was set as an index... it's not that, it's an individual value
		skillsused is now like baseskills and skills for characters (previously unaccessible)
		Removed GetGuildMaster function as it referred to old chars[] array
		Converted CalcTargetedChar function to be similar to CalcTargetedItem so it returns a real object
		onCallback%i will now set targeted to a NULL object if the object clicked on is not valid, or not an object (eg a tile)

	Added the following properties to the JS Character object

		townpriv
		guildtitle
		fonttype
		saycolor
		emotecolor
		attacker
		racegate
		skillLock
		deaths
		nextAct
		petCount		read only
		ownedItemsCount		read only
		cell

	Added the following methods to the JS Character Object

		GetTimer( timerID );
		SetTimer( timerID, numMilliseconds );

	Valid values for timerID are:

		0	//	tCHAR_TIMEOUT
		1	//	tCHAR_INVIS
		2	//	tCHAR_HUNGER
		3	//	tCHAR_POISONTIME
		4	//	tCHAR_POISONTEXT
		5	//	tCHAR_POISONWEAROFF
		6	//	tCHAR_SPELLTIME
		7	//	tCHAR_ANTISPAM
		8	//	tCHAR_CRIMFLAG
		9	//	tCHAR_MURDERRATE

			// NPC Timers
		10	//	tNPC_MOVETIME
		11	//	tNPC_SPATIMER
		12	//	tNPC_SUMMONTIME

			// PC Timers
		13	//	tPC_LOGOUT

	Updated CItem::SetCont so that it doesn't try and do things it shouldn't during world load
	NOTE: We have an issue... we can't validly set all the weight stuff until the world's loaded
	OKAY, the base default world now loads with the new object factory, and it's all fun and games.

06 July 2004 - Maarc
------------
	JS related fixes
		Reenabled the ability to set poison and magic resistance on a race object
		All setProperty routines now use JSEncapsulated, should be *much* more tolerant now
		Any attempt to do something like mSock.currentChar = pUser; would fail, replacing pUser with the actual current char.  It should now behave properly
		It is now possible to set a socket's tempInt property

05 July 2004 - Maarc
------------
	Fixed a problem where it would crash on reloading JS scripts (via magic and commands)
	Removed commented out code that was never used (including tempeffectsoff and tempeffectson)
	Added some methods to help with deletion issues in the temp effects queues
	These fixed an issue where creating a timer on a just elapsed timer would cause a crash
	CCP_TARGET can now be set - char.target = npc;
	More support for floats in the use of properties for characters - dex (x2), int (x2), str (x2), mana, stamina, health
	Note that it will throw an exception if you do not pass a parameter of the right type
	We need a longer term solution to this particular problem.  One idea - create a class JSEncapsulate that takes the JSVal and context, and stores the data internally, with methods that allow it to be casted back to a "proper" value
	As certainly we will need this for more than just the character class

04 July 2004 - Maarc
------------
	nspawnsp and ncspawnsp rolled into CItem class.  Only items can be spawners (not NPCs), and all references to those objects now are done within the CItem class, or through FirstSpawn/NextSpawn/FinishedSpawn
	Updated documents to not use CHARACTER or ITEM unless where it is actually used, to aid in finding where CHARACTER and ITEM references are that need to be ported to CChar * / CItem *
	Updated ObjectFactory with a CountOfObjects method, which allows us to discretely count (if we wish) the number of objects for each type we have
	I believe we've just about covered everything in ObjectFactory that is required to encapsulate chars[] and items[]
	Removed an unused method in WhoList (GrabSerial)
	From what I can see, all references to CHARACTER and ITEM are now done by deletion queues or the char/item handlers
	Added Singleton.h from OGRE, and adapted ObjectFactory to be one.  We can create and delete this in a local context, and use ObjectFactory::getSingleton() everywhere else we might need it.
	Spelling fixes
	Begun the integration of  the ObjectFactory which is #ifdef'd at the moment.  The ObjectFactory integration does NOT compile, and error messages are left in place for what needs to be done.
	Some of the stuff we need to be able to do with the ObjectFactory is essentially, a for every char/item in the world... so what we need to do is support FUNCTORS, I think that would be the most useful
	The question becomes... what sort of functors?  something of the variety of:

	bool MyFunction( cBaseObject *working, UI32 &counter, void *extraData );

	As this will solve almost everything we want to do (reset kills, remove keys and so on), and allow us to bail out early if needed (via the bool, return true if continue, false if not)

	A few functions are implemented thusly (including world load postloadprocessing)

03 July 2004 - Maarc
------------
	Fixed an accidental bug where it would constantly process legacy accounts
	More use of upper() caching
	Added Config.h, Platform.h, Prerequisites.h and UOXStdHeaders.h
	Thrown *everything* into the UOX namespace
	Predeclared most of your classes (not packets, and not a few other minor ones) in Prerequisites.h
	Begun an implementation of an object factory for creation, destruction and recycling of objects.  This is not hooked into the main code pipeline, because some of it still relies on ITEM or CHARACTER types, which we want to eliminate (no more global chars or items!)

	Removed some SE functions (not JS object functions) that relied on chars[]/items[] and hence would fail miserably

		GetLightLevel
		SetPrivateBitRange
		GetPrivateBitRange
		SetPrivateWord
		GetPrivateWord
		SetPrivateBit
		GetPrivateBit
		SetSkillUse
		SkillBeingUsed
		GetGuild
		CompareGuild
		RemoveFromGuild
		AddToGuild
		AttackTarget
		Attack
		IsMemberOfTown
		CalcRank
		UseReagants
		UseReagant
		FindItemOnLayer
		RaceCompare
		GetCharPack
		SetSerial

		SetDecayTime
		GetDecayTime

	chars[] and items[] are now really only referenced in a few small places (less than 10 by array on both, less than 50 by member funcs eg calling Count)

	----------------
	Discussion Ideas
	----------------

	OgreConfig	- Compile time configuration options
	OgrePlatform	- Platform / compiler compatibility file - includes OgreConfig
	OgrePrequesites	- Includes OgrePlatform.  Disables any compiler warnings, stl compliance (eg HashMap) and some typedefs (eg uchar).  Also includes OgreStdHeaders and forward declares any classes needed.

	Should lift off the Singleton class, as it would help with some of our data and initialisation

	Useful classes as Singleton (some possibly lifted from OGRE)

		LogManager

	Other potential useful classes

		template <> FactoryObj
		ResourceManager


	Other possibilities

		Asynchronous network!  Esp under windows, where it can callback at any time - inject events into a queue for the PC
		Consider using a multimap or hash_multimap for storing our object types... given that hash_multimap is like standard, multimap may be a better bet
		However, there are differences: multimaps are sorted, ergo inserts/deletes are logarithmic - hash_maps are not, only hashed, so constant time.  In theory, hash will be better, but given we do little in the way of insert/deletes, multimap would be agood start

7/2/2004 - giwo
	Made use of OnDrop() JS function.
	Cleaned up some areas where we were calling UString::upper() far too many times for a single string.
	Removed unneeded cBO::Load overloads in CItem, CChar, CMultiObj and others.
	Initial implementation of CSpawnItem in order to break CItem up into smaller classes.

02 July 2004 - Maarc
------------

	Fixed display issue with saving packet logs (hex values a->f weren't displayed right)
	Fixed an issue with the add menu that was relying on gumps that didn't exist in older clients
	Fixed CTEffect constructor so it inits the assocScript
	Fixed an issue with StartTimer - it would never call back into another script properly
	Fixed an issue with the action property of spells in JS - it was wrongly declared as an index, not a static param!
	Added ClientCanReceive to CPNewSpellbook so it can fallback on pre-4.x clients to the old method
	Added CCP_SPELLCAST/"spellCast" property to JS Character objects
	Added CCP_ISCASTING/"isCasting" property to JS Character objects
	Added SetJSCasting/IsJSCasting to CChar but this is a *temporary* measure only.  When all spells are outsourced to the JS scripts, it can be removed, so that other code doesn't misbehave (ie the code currently will call CastSpell if you're in casting mode and the timer has elapsed... which won't happen under JS!)

	onSpellCast for JS spells has been changed to:

	onSpellCast( socket, character, directCast, spellNum );

	This allows for multiple spells registered in a single file (eg think all the summon ones, for instance)
	StartTimer now looks like
		BaseObject.StartTime( numMillis, TimerID[, optVal] );

	optVal can either be a boolean (call back into this script, so we don't have to know it's number... this solves non-item/npc scripts so magic can work right) or an integer (the script number to call back into)
	A very basic workflow script exists for clumsy - it does not take everything into account, nor does it actually do the clumsy part, it's just an example.

01 July 2004 - Maarc
------------
	Fixed a bug with newaccounts.adm and parsing
	Converted ImportAccounts to use std::string and UStrings
	Removed the ability to pass "+add:user,pass,email" and "+import:filename.import" arguments to the binary.  This *cannot* be done at this stage, as the accounts haven't been initialised and loaded, so conflict resolution cannot occur.
	Removed typedef of CLPSTR as no variables use it
	Removed some strlwr's in favour of using a UString with lower()
	Substring search now uses UStrings rather than allocating and deallocating char * arrays
	Added character6 to the account property object for JS
	Added a #define CHARACTERCOUNT to cAccountClass to help centralise any changes
	Removed old jsMagicTable_st data
	Added spell equivalents to the JS command registration

		RegisterSpell( spellNumber, isEnabled );
		DisableSpell( spellNumber );
		EnableSpell( spellNumber );

	Spell JS files can be registered by adding entries like this:

	FILE=path/file.js

	into [MAGIC_SCRIPTS]

	Note that it automatically prepends the path to the JS scripts before it, so you only need to put in a relative path (ie same as command scripts)

	onSpellCast( socket, character, directCast );

	socket is the character's socket (not guaranteed to exist, only if PC is casting)
	character is the character casting
	directCast is a boolean
			true if
				an NPC
			false if
				a PC selecting from a spellbook, wand or scroll
				a PC who has casted from a JS script depending on param (ie char.CastSpell( spellNum, true/false ) (if true))

	// It is the responsibility of the JS script to call the proper events (ie onSpellSuccess and so forth)
	// They deal with their own mana subtraction and all sorts of things
	// They also deal with valid regions and what not.  s is *not* guaranteed to be valid (ie it could be an NPC)
	// Suggested script workflow:
	//	* Check if already casting, if so, stop and dump out
	//	* Check if frozen, if so, can't cast spell
	//	* Check if enabled
	//	* Check if scroll, wand or normal cast (scroll reduce requirements, wand do straight away)
	//	* Check requirements (min int, dex, str)
	//	* Check for reagants
	//	* Check if can cast in this area
	//	* Determine if the cast "succeeded"
	//	* If so, fire onSpellSuccess, otherwise fire onSpellFailure.  If failed, speak and return
	//	* Set the player as "casting" and freeze
	//	* Create timer for when the spell will be complete
	//	* Wait for timer to elapse
	//	* Upon timer elapsing,
	//	*	Unfreeze player
	//	*	Send target identifier if any (based on timer) and wait for callback
	//	*	If not target, do action (if any)
	//	*	If target, create onCallback function
	//	*	On callback, do stuff
	//	* NOTE * For area affect spells, use an AreaCharacterFunction

	Note to self - Want to update TriggerEvent so that you don't just pass a script number (though it's possible) but also a variant where you pass a character/socket/item, so that it can use the script associated with that

	The spell JS file also has to include a SpellRegistration command

	function SpellRegistration()
	{
		RegisterSpell( 1, true );	// say, clumsy, same as in the spells.dfn file
	}

	As it stands, only 1 spell per file, unlike the JS commands, which I should probably fix up by adding a spell ID to onSpellCast and passing it all in (would make life much easier for area effect versions of single spells)

19 Sep 2003 - Maarc
	Crash fixes
	Fixes to getTileName to work better with strings and plurality
	banlist.ini/firewall.ini now structured much like a DFN.  It expects all entries to be in the form of:

	[BANNED]
	{
	IP=x.x.x.x
	}

	The [BANNED] is non-specific, it will search through all the sections in that file
	Template banlist.ini is updated as well

	CVS versions of jse_*.scp have been updated to new style
	Reduced number of fopen() calls required by using FileIO->FileExists more

15 Sep 2003 - Maarc
	More internal class members are now either UStrings or std::strings
	More functions updated to use std::string
	Updated HTML template stuff to use UString more
	Almost completely removed all instances of cStringTools::makeString in favour of UString functionality

	Stripped out more unnecessary / unused code
	CharBySerial behaves the same as ItemBySerial in lookups (JS funcs)

	Use of cStringTools down to less than 100 references

14 Sep 2003 - Maarc
	UString classed used in many more places
	Script/ScriptSection updated to use an ifstream rather than a FILE *
	Code reduction through use of UString and ifstreams
	Reordered some logic in functions
	Fixed a bug where PARENTRACE wouldn't work
	Fixed some bugs dealing with polymorph script reading
	Due to VC6 issues, the strToDFN table in ssection.cpp is now a series of assignments instead.  Functionally the same, just something VC6 will handle
	Binary saves ripped out in it's entirety, as there were bugs dealing with it, and a future implementation is planned
	cPBuffer renamed to CPBaseBuffer
	cPUOXBuffer and cPXGMBuffer subclassed from cPBaseBuffer - cPBaseBuffer's old Pack() routine now belongs in cPUOXBuffer
	Enables possible future encryption of xGM seperate from normal UOX packing

12 Sep 2003 - Maarc
	cStringTools is no longer created and instantiated.  It's methods are now static, as it makes clearer sense that way
	Stripped out some functions that weren't called but were transitionary from 0.7x
	Removed cAccountClass::atol as cStringTools offers methods to do that
	Fixed up logic dealing with std::string and the find method

11 Sep 2003 - Maarc
	Few more warning fixes
	Many, many, many changes to try and fix the size comparison issues that VC7.1 pops up with.  This should also make it more portable from 32/64 bit.

	Identified a problem with privileges and binary saves
	Made RandomNum a templated function
	Fixed possible bug with converting strings to dice, wasn't working correctly

10 Sep 2003 - Maarc
	Improved VC compatability with std::min/max
	Cleaned up quite a few warnings and size issues, as revealed by VC7.1
	This means a lot of changes to using size_t where possible

08 Sep 2003 - Maarc
	Some sign issues fixed
	Used std::min / std::max better.  VC6 issue, unsure about higher versions.  VC6 doesn't define min/max in std:: space, but _MIN/_MAX instead.
	Consequently, non VC compilers have std::min/std::max remapped to std::_MIN and std::_MAX.  Not nice, but it works
	Dead functions removed, cleanup of some logic, removed instances where comparisons were always true
	Fixed warnings associated with the running changes implemented last night
	Removed some files that aren't actually used

07 Sep 2003 - Maarc

	Slight tweaks to picking up/dropping
	Updated packet logging to help with more useful dumps
	Updated some more x++ to ++x type of code

		CPMapChange
		CPCharAndStartLoc
		CPCharLocBody
		CPOpenGump
	Updated CPOpenGump so that it's no longer a fragmented packet class, requiring FlushBuffer
	Removed a dead function (itemmenu) that's never used
	Removed dead SE function RunTo, as it's now a character method
	Fixed WalkTo/RunTo as methods - the pathfinding was never doing anything.  Used new npc wander mode of 6, which will purely follow the path
	Those NPCs that are supposed to be running really will be now

06 Sep 2003 - Maarc
	The bounce routine flags the bouncing object as dirty
	---- After preprune tag
	Removed heartbeat and wilderness tags from uox.ini

	Removed an extra startgold entry from uox.ini code
	No longer parse old 0.7x server.scp types
	Fixed Bug: Seconds per UO minute used, but never actually read from the INI file.  Now read/written from/to file.
	Added Console support to dump ini file lookup offsets without running the server.
	Updated console 'V' command to reflect the upcomming pruning of the unused INI tags.
	Fixed a crash bug with onDropItemOnNPC, stupid typo problem
	Updated some setcont code to deal better with layer 0 items, should help with secure trade better
	Change to onAISliver JS event - if js returns true, then server doesn't do normal AI check.  if js returns false, server goes through it's normal routine
	Added some more #ifdef code for some basic boost use - trouble with filesystem currently
	Lots of whitespace updates
	Allowed scripts to be attached to regions, not just items/characters - use SCRIPT tag in the DFN for the region.  Currently supports onEnterRegion and onLeaveRegion (same params as the character version)
	Minor rework of some of the logic in trade code, may or may not help
	Playervendor deed altered to spawn [playervendor] rather than [2117]
	Removed excess PathFix function in cServerDefinitions
	Should be able to browse player vendor packs without a snooping check

	Included the js32.h, and js32.lib files to the source tree. TO help ease *nix users

30 Aug 2003 - Maarc
	Updated InternalPoll for speech, which should solve some compatability issues, and solve delayed speech from not occurring.
	Added some batch files for windows which should help with deployment in future.  They are found in the root, in uox3
	There are 3 predefined templates
		pureinstallcopy		copies data and built binaries
		buildanddatacopy	builds a release executable and does same as pureinstallcopy
		doall			same as buildanddatacopy, but copies source as well
	Each must be called like
		doall c:\app\uoxtest
	The batch files accept a parameter which dictates where the files are to be copied to.
	From there, simple zips can be made.
	Work continues on resurrecting a win32 installer, and communication with Rynet will see a similar process created for Linux.

29 Aug 2003 - Maarc
	Warning and scope fixes only

22 Aug 2003 - Maarc
	Added Empty OnStartup/OnShutdown events( to be expanded upon later )
	Added a JSE class wrapper around UOX3 Account instance to provide access to methods
	Implemented CAccountClass wrapper
	   Created .AddAccount(name,pass,email,flags) to add an account to the server
	   Created .DelAccount(name) or .DelAccount(accountid);
	   NOTE: These are pretty self explanitary.

05 Aug 2003 - Maarc
-----------
	Fixed PC dying issue, not changing to ghost and not turning to gray
	Reinstated terminating NULL with regards to CPOpenBuyWindow, which should hopefully restore pricing in 3D client

03 Aug 2003 - Maarc
-----------
	Fixed issue with delete characters. Now characters should delete correctly, and not list unknown
	values, and erroneous data.
	Fixed an issue with CPIGumpMenuSelect, which was getting radio buttons wrong
	Fixed an issue with BuyFrom, where the logic was backward... should be more like pUser.BuyFrom( NPC ) than NPC.BuyFrom( pUser )
	Fixed similar issue with SellTo
	Added "movable" to area commands on request of Xuri

02 Aug 2003 - Maarc
	Updated CPItemsInContainer so that it will work faster and should work better with vendors
	Updated CPOpenBuyWindow to work better with vendors, and go faster
	Added AoS weapons and LBR-monster weapons (Xuri)
	Vendors work fine in 3D client but not in 2D
	Added a packet specific log routine to CPOpenBuyWindow
	Updated cSocket and other routines to allow for packet specific logging on receive
	Sideeffect of that is that non-packet classes save data already logged for variable length packet
	Implemented Log() routine for CPIFirstLogin, CPISecondLogin, CPIServerSelect, CPIClientVersion and CPIUpdateRangeChange
	Whitespace updates
	setid now has character body restrictions, and is the same as 'poly, which has been upgraded to 0->0x7CF
	Removed JS functions due to equivs
		GetTarget
		SetTarget
		CalcSockFromChar
		CalcDefense
		CalcAttack
		CalcCharFromSock
		GetFlag
		GetTown
		SetTown
		GetRegion
		SetRegion
		VendorBuy	-> BuyFrom method of Char/socket
		VendorSell	-> SellTo method of char/socket
	Added flag property to characters in JS (deals with criminal, murder and so on, read only property)
	Migrated base JS functions to character/item methods
		FinishedItemInCont	-> FinishedItems
		FirstItemInCont		-> FirstItem
		NextItemInCont		-> NextItem
	Dismounting a creature will have the creature face the same way as you
	onDropItemOnNpc event implemented
	First executes for item and if item doesn't bounce, executes for NPC (so item can override bouncing)
	scripts must return a value between 0 and 2
	0 == bounce
	1 == don't bounce, use code
	2 == don't bounce, don't use code
	Updated mounts to support rest of LBR/AOS mounts

01 Aug 2003 - Maarc
	Fixed issue with delete characters. Now characters should delete correctly, and not list unknown values, and erroneous data.
	CChar's attacker property was a CHARACTER, not a CChar * - This lead to mixed ideas of what it's values are
	Changed attacker property to CChar *, which should provide some minor performance benefits
	Fixed a bug with stealing which would flag an index error on failure when not in combat
	OpenURL function on a socket is now enabled
	Closed a minor memory leak with the JS OnTalk event
	Updated version number
	Fixed an issue with NPC response (bank and other commands were not working) - Also affected JS speech
	Found an issue with the vendor buy list.... not working correctly, unsure as to the reason why.  All items are (null) at 0 gp, though icons are fine

31 Jul 2003 - Maarc
	DoStaticEffect (JS function) was both a standalone method (DoStaticEffect) and item/char method (StaticEffect)
	Removed standalone implementation of DoStaticEffect, as it wasn't updated to current implementations and one impl should be used
	Fixed a bug with JS StaticEffect method that would make it not work correctly with items
	JS method table for chars updated to reflect that StaticEffect takes 3 parameters, not 4
	Fixed a crash bug when items tried to talk (via JS or not)
	Some more basic implementation (ifdef'd out) of using boost tokenisation
	Whitespace cleanups
	CPObjectInfo caused crash bug when firefield was cast, fixed
	The criminal() function would cause a server crash if the thing going criminal was an NPC (symptom of EV's crashing server)
	Removed JS onUsage event, and updated onUse in its place
	onUse now requires a return value of either true or false in the script
	if return value true, then it continues on executing with hard coded implementation
	if return value false, then no hard code is executed
	Fixed 'make so that 'make player would work again
	Items can now use the third optional parameter of StartTimer in JS, which enables to call back into the currently executing script
	Updated SetCont so that if it fails to equip, it prints out serial and layer, and resets contObj properly
	Fixed crash with killing characters and corpse clothing
	onUse event fires for a door when it is used, allowing for greater customisation of whether the door can be opened or not

24 Jul 2003 - Maarc
	cPBuffer now has an internal packed buffer, as well as an internal Pack() routine
	cSocket::Send adjusted to use the cPBuffer packed buffer/unpacked where possible
	cPBuffer's packed implementation means that if the packet is sent to multiple sockets, only one pack is needed
	And consequently, runtime performance should be slightly improved (only affects removeitem sort of packets)
	Updated version number

	getTileName updated to behave like in singleClick()
	singleClick now calls getTileName for name lookups rather than basically reproducing the code
	singleClick slightly optimized to only do a character lookup if required
	whitespace cleanups

20 Jul 2003 - Maarc
	Fixed long packet problem
	Fixed possible problem with create skill window
	Converted more things to use CPSendGumpMenu
	Fixed item refresh bug for items created after server load
	Optimized code size for cGuild gumps a touch
	SendVecsAsGump uses CPSendGumpMenu - note, we should be trying to get rid of all uses of SendVecsAsGump
	Commented out a call to Gumps->Open() that locks up later clients (see cstatstarget in cTargets)
	Optimization note for CPSendGumpMenu reuse - look at moving some of the processing from Finalize() to AddCommand()/AddText()

19 Jul 2003 - Maarc
	Fixed a problem with WhichLoginPacket, as it would ignore some valid packet IDs
	Implemented CPSendGumpMenu, an attempt to write a packet class for 0xB0 outbound
	CPSendGumpMenu works for part of wholist and is implemented for 'howto
	However, the size of the packet is bigger than our largest buffer.... and that means that it tramples all over memory
	A fragmenting version is implemented, but the client is more likely than not to lockup
	Real answer?  Crypt and send a buffer big enough to hold the entire packet

18 Jul 2003 - Maarc
	Created a WhichLoginPacket function, to deal specifically with logins only
	WhichLoginPacket will throw an exception if it receives a request that it knows nothing about
	This request is caught and swallowed, via new cSocket::FlushIncoming

17 Jul 2003 - Maarc
	Reduced a number of flush locations
	Books updated to packet classes
	Fixed a bug with reading predefined books

	Turned outbound 0x66 into CPBookPage
	Turned outbound 0x6F into CPSecureTrading
	UseDoor SE function now supports objects not indexes
	MAXLAYERS reduced to 30
	Fixed crashes related to system speech and npcs
	Edited changelog to explicitly mention the month, not using a numeric (not everyone is an American)
	CPDrawContainer model changed from SI16 to UI16
	Updated to version 1g

	Addendum
		Replaced almost all instances of a++ and a-- code with ++a and --a, without breaking semantics
		Implemented a basic boost tokenisation on account parsing of v3 files (ifdef'd out by default)
			Saves approximately 100 lines of code and is more readable

15 Jul 2003 - Maarc

	Command handlers no longer need the offset value, as speech is unified
	Books have partial packet class implementation
	Better use of BASEITEMSERIAL and INVALIDSERIAL

	cGump::OPen converted to use packet class
	Addmenu no longer has nomove tag
	Spellbook start converted to packet class
	CPExtMove now handles flag setting
	Streamlined startChar routine
	I've removed these JS functions (as they have attrib or method equivs)

25 Apr 2003 - giwo
Added:
	Added enum distLocs to simplify distance checking (to avoid confusion over what a certain distance would be IE 1 tile away = 2)
	Added support for setting an items container in JavaScript (object.conainer = newcontainer)
	Added string support for house.dfn allowing house items and house deeds to be strings, not just numbers
	Added new cStringTools class to replace makeNum() with type-matching string-to-number functions
