1. Building
----------------------------------------
If you want to benefit form this feature, you have to install
JavaScript engine from mozilla.org (SpiderMonkey). You have to do it
even when you have Mozilla browser installed, because the binary
browser installation doesn't include essential header files.

If you have installed JS libraries into non-standard directories, you 
need to set (and export) CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH/LIBRARY_PATH to point to
directories where the header files/lib files (e.g. libjs.so) can be found.

The default name for the linked library is 'js' (-ljs switch) - if you
need to override this value, you may set UOX3_JSLIB environment
variable - the configure script uses -l$(UOX3_JSLIB) in this case.

You can installed the javascript development library from your favorite distro
instead of compiling it yourself.

Debian - libsmjs-dev
Red Hat, Fedora Core, Mandrake - libjs*.rpm, libjs-devel*.rpm
Gentoo - spidermonkey
FreeBSD - js-1.5.p6
Other- ???

2. Compilation
-----------------------------------------
The following is the compilation step if your distro don't have the packages.

first get the source
cvs z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot co -P mozilla/js/src

Go into the js/src directory and
make -f Makefile.ref 
(or, if you are *BSD) 
gmake -f Makefile.ref

Now copy the headers to either /usr/local/include or /usr/include or custom directory
jspubtd.h
jscompat.h
jstypes.h
jslong.h
jsotypes.h
jsosdep.h
jsautocfg.h	-> it in the Linux_All_DBG.OBJ directory

Finally copy the lib to either /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib or your custom directory 
libjs.a
libjs.so
