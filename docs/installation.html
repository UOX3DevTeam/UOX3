		<div class="SectionHeader">Installing UOX3</div>
		<p class="Section">There is no complex installation process for UOX3. Just download, unzip, and run. UOX3 makes no changes to your system. Should you ever want to "uninstall" UOX3, just delete the UOX3 folder and it's gone.</p>
		<p class="Section">To "install" UOX3, first download the All-In-One UOX3 package from the <a href="http://www.uox3.org/downloads.shtml" target="_blank">Downloads</a>-page at <a href="http://www.uox3.org" target="_blank">UOX3.org</a>. You'll need a program capable of unpacking .ZIP files to extract the files from the package, so if you don't already have one, and your Operative System doesn't natively support these files, go download WinZip, 7Zip, WinRar or another program that supports extracting .zip files.</p>
		<p class="Section"><em>Note that there may be newer UOX3 versions available since the the latest release, these versions can be accessed by downloading the sourcecode from the CVS and <a href="http://www.uox3.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=453" title="Forum-thread on How to compile UOX3d">compiling it yourself</a>, or by downloading an <a href="http://www.uox3.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=825" title="Link to UOX3 experimental build">experimental build</a>. It's recommended that you download the latest experimental build if it's much newer than the latest release-version, to get the latest fixes and additions to UOX3.</em></p>
		<p class="Section">Once that is out of the way, doubleclick on the All-In-One zip-file and click the 'Extract' button, or click on the Actions-menu and select &quot;Extract&quot; from there. Now enter a path to where you want the UOX3 files to be unpacked. Popular choices include C:\UOX3 or D:\UOX3, but there are no (known) restrictions on this. Once all the files have been extracted, proceed to the next section of this document. </p>
	<div class="SectionHeader">Configuring UOX3</div>
		<p class="Section">After extracting the UOX3 files, browse your way to the newly created UOX3 folder using Explorer or My Computer, then double-click the UOX.INI file (if no file-extensions show up for your files, double-click the one named UOX listed as a &quot;Configurations Settings&quot;-file) to open it in a text-editor.</p>
		<p class="SectionHeader2">Configuration Step 1 - Name and IP, please </p>
		<p class="Section">The <strong>UOX.INI</strong> contains a multitude of settings, and in the future you definitely want to go back in here for some customization, restricting which client-versions are allowed on your shard, etc - but for now you should concentrate on only two, simply to get your server up and running. The first thing you should do is set the name and IP-address of your UOX3 shard, so locate the <em>[play server list]</em> section, which by default will look something like this:</p>
		<p class="blockSection"><em>[play server list]<br>
	    {<br>
	    SERVERLIST=Default UOX3 Server,127.0.0.1,2593<br>
	    }</em></p>
	    <p class="Section">Replace &quot;<em>Default UOX3 Server</em>&quot; with the name you want for your shard. If you're running UOX3 on the same computer as the UO Client, then you don't have to change the default IP address (<em>127.0.0.1</em>) to be able to login. But if you plan on making your server available for others on the Internet, or over a LAN, you might want to either change the IP-address to your Internet/LAN-ip, or add additional SERVERLIST= entries, like this (replace the actual IP-addresses for Online/LAN-server with yours):</p>
		<p class="blockSection"><em>[play server list]<br>
	    {<br>
	    SERVERLIST=Online Server,255.126.73.42,2593<br>
	    SERVERLIST=LAN Server,192.168.1.1,2593<br>
	    SERVERLIST=Offline Server,127.0.0.1,2593<br>
	    }</em></p>
		<p class="SectionHeader2">Configuration Step 2 - Datadirectory Path </p>
	    <p class="Section">Next thing on our list is to make sure that UOX3 can properly access the necessary data-files it needs to run, so locate the <em>[directories]</em> section of the file. Only one directory-path needs to be changed - the path to the <strong>DATADIRECTORY</strong>, which should point to your <strong>Ultima Online</strong> folder. By default Ultima Online is installed to something similar to <em>C:\program files\ultima online\</em>, but if you installed it elsewhere, make sure you enter the correct path here.	 Examples of different paths to the Datadirectory:</p>
		<p class="blockSection"><em>
			DATADIRECTORY=c:\uo\<br>
		  	DATADIRECTORY=c:\ultima online\<br>
	  	DATADIRECTORY=c:\uox3\datafiles\</em></p>
		<p class="blockSection">(In the last example, the following files from the UO folder would be copied to a &quot;datafiles&quot;-folder inside the UOX3 folder: map0.mul, staidx0.mul, statics0.mul, map0.mul, tiledata.mul, multi.mul and multi.idx)</p>
		<p class="Section">When done, save and close <strong>UOX.INI</strong>. </p>
		<p class="SectionHeader2">Configuration Step 3 - Account Setup</p>
		<p class="Section">The last thing you'll need to do before you're done configuring UOX3, is to locate <strong>ACCOUNTS.ADM</strong> in UOX3\ACCOUNTS\ and open it using your favourite text-editor - for instance Notepad (or better yet, Notepad++). The first thing you'll see in that file, is the commented (prefixed by //) example-account. Scroll down past that until you reach the first uncommented account-section, named <strong>SECTION ACCOUNT 0</strong>. </p>
		<p class="Section">That account is your shard's <strong>ADMIN</strong>-account, and you should change the username and password from <em>admin/admin</em> to something a bit harder to guess. Don't make it too hard though, as this is the account you will be logging in with when you need to administer your shard. Any characters created using this account will automatically gain GameMaster-privileges and will have access to all commands in UOX3.</p>
		<p class="Section">After you've changed the default username and password, the first account should look something like this:</p>
		<p class="blockSection"><em>SECTION ACCOUNT 0<br>
	    {<br>
	    NAME newusername <br>
	    PASS newpassword <br>
	    FLAGS 0x8000<br>
	    PATH /uox3/accounts/admin/<br>
	    TIMEBAN 0x0<br>
	    CONTACT unknown<br>
	    CHARACTER-1 0xffffffff [UNKNOWN]<br>
	    CHARACTER-2 0xffffffff [UNKNOWN]<br>
	    CHARACTER-3 0xffffffff [UNKNOWN]<br>
	    CHARACTER-4 0xffffffff [UNKNOWN]<br>
	    CHARACTER-5 0xffffffff [UNKNOWN]<br>
	    } </em></p>
		<p class="Section">That is all you have to change, UOX3 will handle the rest - such as changing the path to the account-data, and more. So save and close the accounts.adm file.</p>
	<div class="extraInfo">
		<p class="Section"><em><strong>Note: </strong></em></p>
		<p class="Section">If you want additional user accounts now or in the future, you can set up those in the <strong>NEWACCOUNTS.ADM </strong>file, which should be located in the same folder as <strong>ACCOUNTS.ADM</strong>. If it's not there, create an empty one yourself.         
		<p class="Section">These additional user accounts must be added using the following format; one account per line, minimum four letters in usernames/passwords. Remember to press 'Enter' after the final line!):
        <p class="blockSection"><em>USER=name,<wbr>pass,<wbr>flags(optional),e-mail(optional)</em></p>
		<p class="blockSection">Example:</p>
		<p class="blockSection"><em>USER=xuri,<wbr>secret,<wbr>0x0,<wbr>xuri@sensewave.com<br>
		USER=charlie,<wbr>barr,<wbr>0x0,<wbr>john@doe.com<br>
		USER=willy,<wbr>knickers,<wbr>0x0<br>
		USER=winston,<wbr>churchill<br>
		</em><b>
	  </b>etc.</p>
		<p class="Section">UOX3 reads <strong>NEWACCOUNTS.ADM</strong> during/after worldsaves, and will then automatically add the new accounts  to the <strong>ACCOUNTS.ADM</strong>-file.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="SectionHeader">Starting UOX3</div>
		<p class="Section">You can now start up your UOX3 shard either by double-clicking on UOX3.EXE in your UOX3 folder, or by starting it from a command prompt - which is recommended since then the UOX3 window won't close if there's an error. If everything goes according to plan, you should see no errors during startup (ignore any instances of [Skipped]), and UOX3 will come to a halt at the following lines.</p>
		<p class="blockSection"><em>| UOX: Startup Complete<br>
	    o------------------------------------------------------------------------------o<br>
	    | Thread: CheckConsoleThread has started</em></p>
		<p class="Section">If you do see any errors, and UOX3 never reaches the above mentioned lines, then you should revisit the earlier sections of this guide to see where you might have done something wrong.</p>
		<p class="Section">One thing you should take note of right now, is that by default your shard will be empty of any Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and decorative/usable items such as roadsigns, doors and containers. You can fix this by either populating your world manually after logging in, or by downloading premade spawn and/or worldfiles from the <a href="http://www.uox3.org" title="UOX3 Downloads-page">UOX3 Downloads</a>-page.</p>
	<div class="SectionHeader">(Shutting down  UOX3)</div>
		<p class="Section">Should you need to shut down UOX3 for any reason, it's important that you do it correctly to avoid the loss of characters/items/changes to your world. If you simply close UOX3  by clicking the 'X' in the top right corner of the console window, any changes since the last worldsave will be lost!</p>
		<p class="Section">To properly shut down UOX3, either use the in-game command <strong>'SHUTDOWN #</strong> where # is the number of seconds until the shutdown occurs (will be globally announced), or press '<strong>*</strong>' in the console window to disable safe-mode, followed by either '<strong>Q</strong>' or the '<strong>Esc</strong>'-key.</p>
		<p class="Section">This will prompt UOX3 to perform a worldsave before shutting down properly.</p>
	<div class="SectionHeader">Configuring the UO Client </div>
		<p class="Section">If no errors occur during startup, and your shard is up and running (keep the UOX3 window running!), it's time to <a href="client-config.html">configure the UO client</a>.</p>
	    <div class="extraInfo">
		<p class="Section"><em><strong>Note: </strong></em></p>
		<p class="Section">For further customization of your shard, check out the <a href="server-settings.html">server-settings</a>-page, which contains all the details about the various settings available in UOX.INI. </p>
