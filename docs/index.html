					<p>UOX3 - or <strong>Ultima Offline eXperiment 3</strong> - is an open-source server emulator for Ultima Online that allows you to run your own private (or public) UO server where <em>you</em> are in control of what rules apply, what features are available and what type of players will inhibit Britannia.</p>

					<!--<h4>Core Server Features</h4>-->
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler1"/>
					<label for="spoiler1">Core UOX3 Features <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>The core features listed below are the heart and soul of UOX3, and are what helps UOX3 stand out in the UO server emulator space:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Open Source (C/C++)</strong> - You can download, experiment with and make changes to the source code to fit the particular needs of your UOX3 shard, or branch off to create a spin-off emulator that can be successful in its own right (see UO Emulator timeline for a history of such spin-offs).</li>
							<li><strong>Cross-Platform Support</strong> - UOX3 strives to maintain cross-platform support, so it can run on a variety of Windows, Linux and macOS versions and configurations (including 64-bit ones).</li>
							<li><strong>JavaScript-based Scripting Engine</strong> - UOX3's JS-based scripting engine is a powerful tool that allows anyone with a rudimentary understanding of JavaScript to create new features or enhance existing ones, all without having to dig deep into the C/C++ core of UOX3. Also includes a "packet hook" system that allows intercepting network packets sent by connected clients, and sending custom network packets in response.</li>
							<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_js_example"/>
							<label for="spoiler_js_example">JS example <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
							<div class="spoiler">
								<p>Script that lets players tip cows over by double-clicking them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function onCharDoubleClick( pUser, targChar ) // DoubleClick Event
{
	// Generate random number from 0 to 100
	var rndValue = RandomNumber( 0, 100 );

	// If random number was lower than 5, tip the cow!
	if( rndValue < 5 )
	{
		targChar.DoAction( 8 ); // Play falling over animation on cow
		targChar.SoundEffect( 0x78, true ); // Cow goes moo!
	}
}</code></pre>
							</div>
							<li><strong>DFN Files</strong> - The definition files, written in flat text files, act as easily editable blueprints and templates for items, NPCs, regions, skills, player races and more.</li>
							<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_dfn_example"/>
							<label for="spoiler_dfn_example">DFN example <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>

}</code></pre>
							</div>
							<li><strong>Dynamic Reloading of Scripts</strong> - Any scripts, definition files and ini files used by UOX3 can be reloaded on the fly - in just a few seconds - while the server is already running. This makes it easy for shard admins and developers to quickly iterate on changes and additions, without having to restart the server from scratch and reconnect the client to see each change.</li>
							<li><strong>Custom Object Tags</strong> - Custom string/int tags can be added to any character or item (including multis) via JS scripts or Item/NPC definitions - either of which can be reloaded on the fly if needed. No need to ask developers to add a custom tag in the source... just add it yourself! No serialization headaches required.</li>
							<li><strong>UO Client Support</strong> - UOX3 supports a wide range of UO client versions, all the way from the 4.x versions originally introduced with the Age of Shadows expansion in 2003, to the most recent 7.0.x series available today.</li>
							<li><strong>Multi-Language Support</strong> - UOX3 comes with a custom dictionary system that allows for sending script and system messages to connected clients in the client's default language.</li>
							<li><strong>Extensive Log System</strong> - UOX3 comes with an extensive log system that tracks server errors, warnings, network packets sent and received for each client, commands used, spells cast, combat events, player speech and more.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_customization_options"/>
					<label for="spoiler_customization_options">Customization Options <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>UOX3 has many settings and options that can be tweaked via the main configuration file, uox.ini, as well as in individual regions of the world. More in-depth tweaks are also possible by editing various JS files for skills and items:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Client Blocking</strong> - Mix and match which client versions to allow on your shard. Players using unsupported clients will be blocked and/or disconnected shortly after joining the shard.</li>
							<li><strong>Feature Negotiation</strong> - UOX3 supports negotiating features with assistant tools that support this, like Razor. Enable or disable various assistant functions like auto-remounting, weather filter and more.</li>
							<li><strong>ClassicUO Map Tracker</strong> - If using the ClassicUO client's World Map, guild and party members will show up on the map if this option is enabled.</li>
							<li><strong>Skill and Stat-caps</strong> - Choose skill and stat-caps for all players via two simple settings.</li>
							<li><strong>Rogue Skills</strong> - Adjust the amount of steps players can take while stealthing, make snooping a crime - or legalize it, disable hostile skills in protected regions, or disable rogue skills altogether.</li>
							<li><strong>Timers and Effects</strong> - Easily tweak timers for decay, weather updates, shop restock, object use delay, idle disconnect, mana regen and more. Fine-tune NPC AI reaction time and the movement speed of NPCs and Boats.</li>
							<li><strong>Automatic Account Creation</strong> - Enable automatic account creation for anyone that attempts to log in, or keep control of who can join your shard by adding accounts manually.</li>
							<li><strong>Creature Control</strong> - Customize which SFX and animations are used for each particular creature, and decide which ones walk on dry land, which ones swim in the sea and which ones fly in the air.</li>
							<li><strong>Client/Server Features</strong> - Full control over which features get enabled in client and on server.</li>
							<li><strong>Spell Tweaks </strong> - Want to customize the delay of the Explosion spell, the damage of the Flamestrike spell, the FX of the Magic Missile spell or the SFX of the Teleport spell? No problem.</li>
							<li><strong>Combat Tweaks</strong> - Cap the max range of archery weapons, turn off damage numbers in combat, give animals a chance to attack players or to flee once their health reaches the threshold you set.</li>
							<li><strong>Maps, maps, maps</strong> - Support for pre-ML or post-ML map sizes (or custom sizes, if client allows), and for reading map data in either .mul or .uop formats.</li>
							<li><strong>Housing</strong> - Track house ownership per character or per account, specify how many houses players can own/co-own, enable/disable item decay in houses, customize lockdowns, secure containers, vendors and more per house type.</li>
						</ul>

					<!--<h4>Custom Gameplay Features</h4>-->
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler2"/>
					<label for="spoiler2">Custom Gameplay Features <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>UOX3 comes pre-packed with a host of custom (and optional) features that can be customized and tweaked by shard admins:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Region System & Player-run Towns</strong> - Region system with built-in support for player-run towns.</li>
							<li><strong>Regional Weather System</strong> - A region-specific weather system allows each region of the game world to have its own unique weather setup, with temperature swings, heat waves, cold snaps, rain, snow and wind - all of which ties into a race system where specific races can have weaknesses or strengths tied to specific weather or temperatures.</li>
							<li><strong>Regional Spawning System</strong> - The regional spawning system allows UOX3 shards to spawn an enormous amount of NPCs and items in the game world without significantly increased world-save and load times, since the objects spawned through this system are only kept in memory for as long as the server is running, and will respawn upon startup.</li>
							<li><strong>Advanced Trade System</strong> - The advanced trade system in UOX3 can be used to setup dynamic prices for goods with NPC vendors across the game world, with prices fluctuating based on the amount of items sold to or bought from players in each region.</li>
							<li><strong>Customizable Ore System</strong> - Customize the types of ore available in your world, where to find them and how hard they are to dig out of the ground.</li>
							<li><strong>Rank and Quality Crafting System</strong> - Custom rank system for crafting skills allow for variable stats and quality of crafted items.</li>
							<li><strong>Race System</strong> - The race system in UOX3 is an extensive and customizable system that can be applied to both players and NPCs. Through this system, races can be setup as allies or enemies, can be given skill bonuses or penalties, have different skill and stat caps, can take extra damage from specific weapons (undead race vs silver weapons, for instance), and more.</li>
							<li><strong>Advancement Gates</strong> - Shard admins can setup "advancement gates" which sets up players who step through them with specific skills, stats and equipment, and can be used to give players a head start or to setup predefined "classes" beyond what the UO client's character creation options allow for.</li>
							<li><strong>Persecution</strong> - Getting killed on an UOX3 shard is not the end. Ghosts can fight back! By entering combat mode, ghosts can cause trouble for their killers by draining their mana at opportune moments!</li>
							<li><strong>Ambient Footstep Sounds</strong> - Ever noticed how in regular UO, the footsteps of your character always sound the same, no matter what kind of surface you walk on? Enable ambient footstep sounds in UOX3, and you'll be walking on wood, gravel, stone and swamp in no time!</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<!--<h4>UO-Specific Gameplay Features</h4>-->
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler3"/>
					<label for="spoiler3">UO-Specific Gameplay Features <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>UOX3 also supports various features from regular UO:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Combat</strong> - Combat system with rules that align closely with official UO around the time of Publish 15/16, just before the release of the Age of Shadows expansion. Ruleset can be modified and/or extended to support specific preferences.</li>
							<li><strong>Crafting</strong> - Prefer baking bread over hacking and slashing? Try your hand at Alchemy, Bowcraft, Carpentry, Cartography, Inscription, Smithing, Tailoring or Tinkering!</li>
							<li><strong>Gathering</strong> - Mine your way to an ingot empire, introduce some trees to your friend - the axe, or relax with some casual fishing.</li>
							<li><strong>Persistent Housing</strong> - Classic persistent housing system with lockdowns, secure containers, co-owners, friendlists, public/private houses.</li>
							<li><strong>Party System</strong> - Party up with friends and share a private, server-wide chat.</li>
							<li><strong>Guildstones</strong> - Guild system that relies on classic guildstones that can be placed in player's houses.</li>
							<li><strong>Player Vendors</strong> - Set up a trade empire across Britannia with a little help from player vendors!</li>

					<p>"Story? You mean UOX3 has <strong><em>LORE</em></strong>?"</p>
					<p>Yep! As the only UO Server Emulator, UOX3 comes with its own background story, originally written by Cironian back in 1997/1998. Check it out below!</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_uox3_story_1"/>
					<label for="spoiler_uox3_story_1">Chapter One - Death <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p class="pStory"><span class="highlight">Y</span>ou knew that the world was ending right now before your eyes, and there was nothing you could do about it anymore. Lord British was dead and the Guardians demon legions were swarming all through the once proud city of Britain. Bodies were lying all around the streets, thieves next to nobles and the former castle guards.</p>

						<p>That body which you used to call your own is still bleeding at your slightly transparent feet but it is obviously too late for any kind of medical treatment. Your spells have allowed you to take two of those red abnormities with you, but when the Shadowlord Astaroth approached you, you knew that your last minute has come. You stood paralysed as his dark finger stretched out to your chest and when it touched you, you had left your body even before it hit the ground. You notice that some of those who are falling to the assault of the demons don't even leave a spirit behind anymore; it seems like after his death the magic that Lord British gave to his citizens to survive past their own death is beginning to fade.</p>

						<p>Having wandered through the bloody streets for some time you see that there is still some light spilling through the windows of one of the nearby houses. You glance up to the sign above the door and note the symbol of the virtues, the ankh, painted onto it. Even though you ghostly state denies all colors of the world reach you, somehow you still recognize the golden color of the symbol. After thinking for only a moment you reach for the doorknob, only to see your hand go right through it. "Oh, I forgot...", you smile to yourself, these words being only a whisper in the storm of the fighting to those still standing locked in combat with the demonic hordes.</p>

						<p>Despite your current disembodied state you take a deep breath and then step right through the closed door.</p>
					</div>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_uox3_story_2"/>
					<label for="spoiler_uox3_story_2">Chapter Two - End of the world <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p class="pStory"><span class="highlight">I</span>nside the building you can make out a few people in grey robes, sitting around a candle like it could protect them from the Guardians assault outside. One of the people seems to note your presense and turns around:</p>

						<p>"Ah, another lost soul that has found the way here. With the forces of chaos drawing into this realm, my healing powers are fading from minute to minute, but I might try to give you a new body if you assist me".
						The healer is beginning to make arcane gestures and you feel a wave of restoring energy rush through your astral body. With the rest of your powers you finally succeed to become physical again.</p>

						<p>"This is it", the healer says, "my powers are now completely gone". You place your weak body among the others and listen to the screams outside, although those are becoming less and less by now.</p>

						<p>You know that this new life will certainly only last for a couple of minutes, as the magic forces which bind this world together are beginning to fail, with obvious consequences: Lightnings are striking down from the sky by the dozen, giant earthquakes are threatening to tear the land apart and you can almost feel the pure evil power of the Guardian condensing in the air, converting this world to - what? You remember hearing one of the court mages whisper with his dying breath that the Guardian would use conquered worlds to create the Shadowlords. If that is true, then this world is really lost.</p>

						<p>You glance out through the window and see one of the black moongates open with more demons stepping out of it. A thought crosses your mind: There can be no place worse than this one, so it might be worth the try. You tell the others that you intend to go through one of those gates to survive the end of this world and most of them agree to try it. You walk over to the door and silently unlock it and open it just so much that you can get a look at a part of the road outside. What you see is terrible. Sweet Dreams Inn is already completely burned down and the ground seems to be painted with blood.</p>

						<p>"Now!", you scream as you see another of the black gates open just a few steps away from the door. You hit the door open and start to run, but just a second before you would have reached the gate a demon steps out of it, looking down at you in a quite angry way. You signal the other to run into the gate while you divert the creature, even though you have no idea on how to do that. As it rushes toward you, you notice one of Lord Britishs personal castle guards lying on the ground here. Still in his hand you see one of the famous order shields, magically treated by the King himself. You reach for it and with all your strength hold it in front of you as the demon brings his fist down on you.</p>

						<p>The shield is shattered in two under the might of the blow, but by that the magic still inherent in it is released in a brilliant flash of light; not enough to kill the demon, but enough to render it helpless for a moment and you do not need any more time to run between its legs and towards the black gate. Knowing that this world could die any second now you jump through the gate...</p>

						<p>You find yourself flying through some sort of dark tunnel; at the end of which you see another world. But you can't say that world appears much better to you than the one you just left, because it looks like the homeland of the demons. Thousands of them are waiting at the exit of the gate and it seems like they have already taken care of those that entered the gate before you. You look back over your shoulder at the place you came from and at the same moment that world ends. Suddendly the gate, having lost one of its exits vanishes, leaving you suspended in the Ethereal Void.</p>

						<p>You see millions of stars all around you, except that those are no stars but worlds; just like the one you were born and lived in until this day, and another one of them is now serving the Guardian...</p>

					<div class="spoiler">
						<p class="pStory"><span class="highlight">Y</span>ou awaken. You are lying on a perfectly ordinary bed in an absolutely normal room of an inn. You rise to your feet and look out of the window to see the wonderful town of Britain, still quite unharmed as if that which you remember never happened. You get dressed and walk down the stairs of the inn. The first thing you notice is the lack of people that are usually shoving past each other here. On the street you see that this phenomenon is not limited to the inn, but seems to be present all around Britain.</p>

						<p>You spin around as you notice a movement in the corner of your eye. Your eyes widen as you see Lord Blackthorne himself standing there as if the Guardians attack on Britannia never happened.</p>

						<p>"I guess thou hast questions on your mind", your hear him,"like why thou art here when your memories tell thee that everything must be quite different. The reason for that is that thou art no longer in the world that thou knowest - nor one even like it. As thou possibly knowest, there are thousands of copies of the land called Britannia existing in the shards of Mondains foul gem of immortality. Now, for some reason when the worlds were split from each other, this special world was created without any inhabitants. Now, as the creature calling himself the Guardian conquered other worlds like yours, some people always entered one of the black moongates in the moment of destruction and thus ending up here. Thou mightest call this world the Lost Splinter. Well, I would really like to discuss this matter further with thee, but I am due for a game of chess with Lord British."</p>

						<p>"He lives?", you exclaim. "Well, in fact the two of us ended up here when we were fleeing from the world that later became the Shadowlord Nosfentor." His face turns sad: "How fitting to run away from that world which became the embodiment of cowardice... But now I must hasten to the castle. Feel free to take a look around this world. There are not many people here, but at least the ecology yield more than enough food and resources for us few."</p>

						<p>As you watch the Lord disappear down the street you start to think. At least you would be safe from the Guardian here - for now. You start to walk through an unusually empty Britain; there is so much to learn about this world, so you might as well start right now.</p>

					<h3>OS / Platform</h3>
					<p>UOX3 comes with cross-platform support for running on a variety of <strong>Windows</strong> (~Win7 to Win10), <strong>Linux</strong> and <strong>macOS</strong> versions, in both 32bit and 64bit.</p>
					<h3>Hardware</h3>
					<p>Default install size for UOX3 alone clocks in at under 8MB, with an additional 400-500 MB being required for data files from Ultima Online. Total size will grow based on amount of content added to shard. Minimum 1+ GB free storage space recommended.</p>
					<p>Default memory usage for an empty shard ranges from 35-50 MB, but will grow based on amount of content added to shard and number of players connected at any given time. Minimum 1+ GB RAM recommended.</p>
					<h3>Ultima Online Client</h3>
					<p>It is highly recommended to use the same data files for your UOX3 shard as found in the Ultima Online client you will be connecting to UOX3 with, to minimize the chance of issues related to mismatching files.</p>
					<p>UOX3 currently supports client versions ranging from <strong>4.0.0p</strong> to at least <strong>7.0.90.x</strong>, and requires the following minimum set of UO data files to run:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>map0.mul/map0LegacyMUL.uop</strong> (depending on client version)</li>
						<li><strong>staidx0.mul</strong></li>
						<li><strong>statics0.mul</strong></li>
						<li><strong>multi.mul / MultiCollection.uop</strong> (depending on client version)</li>
						<li><strong>multi.idx</strong> (not needed if using MultiCollection.uop)</li>
						<li><strong>tiledata.mul</strong></li>
					</ul></p>
					<p>Additional map and statics data files are optional, and required only if you want the other worlds/facets to be available on your shard.</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_mulvsuop"/>
					<label for="spoiler_mulvsuop">Bonus Tip - MUL vs UOP Map Files <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>Clients after v7.0.24.2 started using new file format for map files - uop - that previously required conversion to mul format in order to be loaded by UOX3, leading to a recommendation of using a client version earlier than this. However, starting with v0.99.3, UOX3 <strong>can</strong> now load these uop files directly. <strong>No need to convert!</strong> If for whatever reason you still want to convert files between the .mul and .uop formats, check out the <a href="#convertUOP">Additional UOX3 Info > Converting UOP to MUL</a> section!</p>
					</div>
					<p><strong>It is strongly recommended</strong> that you download and install a version of Ultima Online <strong>before</strong> continuing with the download and setup of UOX3 itself. You can either download the latest available <strong>Classic Client</strong> from <a href="https://uo.com/client-download/" target="_blank" title="Official UO homepage - client download">the official UO website</a>, or you can head on over to <a href="https://www.uox3.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=2289" target="_blank" title="UOX3 Community Forums - UO Client Compatibility">the community forums</a> to read more about UOX3's compatibility with various UO Client versions.</p>
					<p>While you're at it, go grab the <a href="http://www.uor-razor.com/" target="_blank">UO:R Community Edition of Razor</a>, a tool you'll need later to remove the encryption from the UO client, allowing it to connect to UOX3 - which only accepts encryption-less connections. Alternatively, you can use <a href="https://github.com/andreakarasho/ClassicUO" target="_blank" title="ClassicUO - open source UO client">ClassicUO</a> - an open source client with many extra bells and whistles.</p>
					<h3>Linux/macOS Platforms</h3>
					<p>While UOX3 supports both Linux and macOS, neither the standard UO client nor Razor run natively on these platforms. As an alternative, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/andreakarasho/ClassicUO" target="_blank" title="ClassicUO - open source UO client">ClassicUO</a>, an open-source, cross-platform client that supports both Linux and macOS (and Windows!), and which does not rely on Razor to work.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
				  <div class="text-component">
					<p>To get started with UOX3, you have a couple of different options:</p>
					<h3>1) Stable All-in-One</h3>
					<p>The first, and most straight-forward option is to download the latest stable <strong>All-in-One UOX3 package</strong> for your platform (Windows/Linux/macOS) from the <a href="https://www.uox3.org/downloads.shtml" target="_blank" title="UOX3.org Downloads page">Downloads page at UOX3.org</a>. It contains all the files you need to get a bare-bones version of UOX3 up and running; a clean slate for you to build on.</p>
					<h3>2) Experimental Build</h3>
					<p>If it has been some time since the stable All-in-One package was updated, it might be a better approach to try out the <strong>"Experimental Build"</strong> sometimes posted on the <a href="https://www.uox3.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=825" target="_blank" title="UOX3 Community Foums - Experimental Builds">forums at UOX3.org</a>. These versions contain all the latest changes and additions that have been made to UOX3 since the previous stable release, but could also potentially contain additional bugs and errors due to the "cutting edge" nature.</p>
					<div class="note"><p style="color: black; font-style: italic">Note: For <strong>either</strong> of the two above options, unzip the downloaded file to a folder of your choice, preferably something easy to find and access, like C:\UOX3.</p></div>
					<h3>3) Compile Source Yourself</h3>
					<p>The third option, for more advanced users, would be to <strong>download the UOX3 source-code directly from GitHub and compile it yourself</strong>. If you're interested in the inner workings of UOX3 and/or potentially want to contribute code-wise, or just like to live life on the edge and want to stay up-to-date with the most recent changes at any given point of time, this might be the option for you. See <a href="#compilingUOX3">Additional UOX3 Info > Compiling UOX3 Source</a> for further instructions!</p>

					<label for="spoiler_tldr_config">tldr; - Quick Start Guide <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>If you think the detailed instructions below are too wordy, try this quick start guide instead, and refer to the full setup guide if you run into any problems along the way:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Download the <a href="https://uo.com/client-download/" target="_blank" title="Official UO homepage - client download">UO Client</a>, and <a href="http://www.uor-razor.com/" target="_blank" title="UO:R Community Edition of Razor">Razor</a>. Run Razor in WinXP SP2/3 Compatibility mode. For Linux/macOS users, find a way to copy the installed UO directory on a Windows machine over to your Linux/macOS one, and then rely on <a href="https://www.classicuo.eu/" target="_blank" title="ClassicUO - Open Source UO Client">ClassicUO</a> client (also available for Windows-users!) instead of the UO+Razor combination.</li>
							<li>Download <a href="https://www.uox3.org/downloads.shtml" target="_blank" title="UOX3.org Downloads page">UOX3</a> for your platform of choice.</li>
							<li>Set client versions allowed on your shard via <strong>CLIENTSUPPORT#</strong> lines in <em>[clientsupport]</em> section of <strong>UOX.INI</strong>.</li>
							<li>Update <strong>SERVERNAME</strong> (name of your shard) and optionally <strong>EXTERNALIP</strong> (your internet IP) in <em>[system]</em> section of <strong>UOX.INI</strong>. If you just want to connect locally on same computer, leave EXTERNALIP alone</li>
							<li>Update <strong>DATADIRECTORY</strong> path in <em>[directories]</em> section of <strong>UOX.INI</strong>; point it to UO folder, or folder with UO data files.</li>
							<li>Change default <strong>username</strong>/<strong>password</strong> for <em>account 0</em> (admin account) in <strong>UOX3/accounts/accounts.adm</strong>.</li>
							<li>Start UOX3!</li>
							<li>Start Razor and use it to load up the UO client (or use ClassicUO), then log in!</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<p>Assuming you now have a UOX3 folder that contains <em>UOX3.exe</em> (Windows only), <em>uox3 binary</em> (Linux/macOS only), some .ini files and a bunch of folders like <em>accounts</em>, <em>dfndata</em> and <em>js</em>, it's time to dig in and get your hands dirty with some ini editing!</p>
					<h3>Step 1) Open UOX.INI</h3>
					<p>Open <span class="highlight">UOX.INI</span> from the root UOX3 folder using your favourite text editor (Notepad, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank" title="Notepad++ homepage">Notepad++</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" title="Sublime Text Editor homepage">Sublime Text</a>, Vim, nano, etc.)
					<h3>Step 2) Name Your Shard</h3>
					<p>Under the <span class="highlight">[system]</span> section, look for the line similar to <span class="highlight">SERVERNAME=My UOX3 Shard</span>.</p>
					<p>Replace <span class="highlight">"My UOX3 Shard"</span> with the name you'd like to use for your UOX3 shard. Keep the name short (preferably 16-20 chars); the longer it is, the less likely it will show up in the UO client's server list without being truncated.</p>
					<h3>Step 3) Set the IP Address and Port</h3>
					<p>By default, UOX3 will work for <strong>local connections</strong> with <strong>no further changes required</strong> in this step, i.e. when connecting with UO client on same computer as UOX3, or connecting across a home LAN/WiFi.</p>
					<p>However, if you intend to have your UOX3 shard <strong>accessible to other people</strong> over the Internet, you need to replace <span class="highlight">127.0.0.1</span> in the line <span class="highlight">EXTERNALIP=127.0.0.1</span> with your public Internet IP. An additional step that might be required here, is to configure your Internet router to forward incoming connections to your local computer via a concept called <a href="https://www.uox3.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=2348" target="_blank" title="UOX3 Forum - Frequently Asked Questions - Port Forwarding">port forwarding</a> (check linked FAQ answer on UOX3 forums for more info).</p>
					<p>Speaking of ports - the ini setting <span class="highlight">PORT=2593</span> determines the port UOX3 will be listening for incoming connections on. Usually this can be left as the default value, unless you have specific reasons to use a different port.</p>
					<h3>Step 4) Limit Allowed Client Versions</h3>
					<p>Under the <span class="highlight">[clientsupport]</span> section, enable or disable specific UO client version ranges to determine which versions of the UO client are allowed to connect to your UOX3 shard. As a general rule, try to keep the allowed ranges as narrow as possible to avoid potential issues with different client versions behaving differently. Any client version you enable here also enable a range of versions up to the version in the next available setting.</p>
					<h3>Step 5) Set the path to UO files</h3>
					<p>Scroll down to the <strong>[directories]</strong> section of the ini file, and locate this line:</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px"><span class="highlight">DATADIRECTORY=C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Ultima Online Classic</span></p>
					<p>If you're running UOX3 on the same computer as your UO client, point the DATADIRECTORY filepath to the folder where you installed Ultima Online.</p>
					<p>If you're running UOX3 on a computer without the UO client installed, point the DATADIRECTORY filepath to a folder that contains the following data-files, copied from the UO Client:</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_config_requiredfiles"/>
					<label for="spoiler_config_requiredfiles">List of Required UO Data Files <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<ul>
							<li><span class="highlight">map*.mul / map*LegacyMUL.uop</span> (Depending on client version)</li>
							<li><span class="highlight">mapdif*.mul</span> (Only certain older client versions)</li>
							<li><span class="highlight">multi.idx / MultiCollection.uop</span> (Depending on client version)</li>
							<li><span class="highlight">multi.mul</span> (Not needed if using MultiCollection.uop)</li>
							<li><span class="highlight">stadif*.mul</span> (Only certain older client versions)</li>
							<li><span class="highlight">staidx*.mul</span></li>
							<li><span class="highlight">statics*.mul</span></li>
							<li><span class="highlight">tiledata.mul</span></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="note">
							<p style="color: black; font-style: italic">NOTE: The * in the above filenames indicate that there's more than one similarly named files, and the different numbers in each filename represents a different world/facet. If you want your shard to support all the available worlds/facets in the client, make sure to copy all of these files. Alternatively, just copy the files with a 0 in the name, if you just want the original UO map and nothing else - although be aware that in this case players will be unable to go to those additional worlds!</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h3>Step 6) Setting up the Admin Account</h3>
					<p>The <strong>final step</strong> in the UOX3 setup process is to setup the administrator account for your shard! <strong>Save and close UOX.INI</strong>, and instead navigate your way to the <em>UOX3/accounts/</em> folder, where you <span class="highlight">open accounts.adm</span> in your text editor, before locating this section of the file:</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_config_accountsetup"/>
					<label for="spoiler_config_accountsetup">accounts.adm <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						...
						<p><em>SECTION ACCOUNT 0<br>
						{<br>
						<strong>NAME admin<br>
						PASS admin</strong><br>
						FLAGS 0x8000<br>
						PATH ./accounts/admin/<br>
						TIMEBAN 0x0<br>
						LASTIP 127.0.0.1<br>
						CONTACT unknown<br>
						CHARACTER-1 0xffffffff [UNKNOWN]<br>
						CHARACTER-2 0xffffffff [UNKNOWN]<br>
						CHARACTER-3 0xffffffff [UNKNOWN]<br>
						CHARACTER-4 0xffffffff [UNKNOWN]<br>
						CHARACTER-5 0xffffffff [UNKNOWN]<br>
						CHARACTER-6 0xffffffff [UNKNOWN]<br>
						CHARACTER-7 0xffffffff [UNKNOWN]<br>
						}</em></p>
						...
					</div>
					<p>This is account #0 on your shard, also known as the administrator account. Any character created on this account will <strong>automatically be granted all GM and Admin powers</strong>. As such, it would be a good idea to <span class="highlight">change the username and password</span> from the default ADMIN/ADMIN to something more original, creative and most importantly - <strong>secure</strong>! Note that it can be a good idea to create a second, non-admin account to use for testing purposes, as GM/Admin characters are often not subject to the same gameplay rules as regular players.</p>
					<p>Additional accounts can be created by <strong>copying an existing SECTION ACCOUNT #</strong> (like the default guest account) and pasting it at the bottom of the file, followed by <strong>manually incrementing the account number</strong> of the new account to the next available number (1 higher than the previous one), <strong>changing the username/password/contact info</strong> and ensuring all the character references are set to <strong>0xffffffff [UNKNOWN]</strong>.</p>
					<p>If you make changes to this file while UOX3 is already running, you will have to reload the accounts from UOX3's console menu.</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_acctCreationBonus"/>
					<label for="spoiler_acctCreationBonus">Bonus Tips - Additional Account Creation Methods <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p><strong>Tip #1 - Add accounts via in-game command</strong></p>
						<p>While your UOX3 shard is already running, you can add more accounts via the in-game Admin command <span class="highlight">'addaccount</span>. Any accounts added via this command are instantly available for use. Syntax: <span class="highlight">addaccount [username] [password] [flags]</span></p>
						<p>Example: <span class="highlight">'addaccount guest2 guest2 0x0</span></p>
						<p><strong>Tip #2 - Add accounts through newaccounts.adm</strong></p>
						<p>Another alternate way of adding new accounts is to edit - or create, if it doesn't already exist, a file called <strong>newaccounts.adm</strong> in the root accounts folder, and adding one line per account you want to create, matching the following syntax:</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 20px"><span class="highlight">USER=[username],[password],[flags],[email]</span></p>
						<p>Note that additions to newaccounts.adm only go into effect when the server is restarted.</p>
						<p><strong>Tip #3 - Enable auto-creation of accounts</strong></p>
						<p>Finally, you can enable <strong>auto-creation of accounts on login</strong> by setting the UOX.INI setting <span class="highlight">INTERNALACCOUNTCREATION</span> from 0 to 1 and restarting your UOX3 shard (or reloading the INI from the UOX3 console menu). This will automatically create a new account for anyone who attempts to login to your shard with an unrecognized account-name. Beware that this could make it easier for someone to cause trouble for your shard, as even if you ban a problem user's account, they can just create a new account straight away. To solve this issue, you might need to ban them by IP via banlist.ini instead!</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
				  <div class="text-component">
				  <h3>Decorating your World with Items</h3>
				  <p>By default, UOX3 comes as a blank slate - <strong>a tabula rasa</strong> - on which you can build and craft your own unique UO shard. However, should you wish to get a head-start, you will - on first login with a character on the admin account - <strong>get the option</strong> to <span class="highlight">automatically decorate your shard</span> based on some default <a href="#worldTemplates" title="UOX3 Documentation - World Templates">world templates</a> (based on the older "<em>default UOX3 worldfiles</em>") provided with UOX3, which generates items such as doors, signs, lights and more. For now, these templates cover all the mainland UO towns on the Felucca facet (world 0).</p>
				  <p>This option is presented in a <strong>gump</strong> (UO term for menu) that pops up on login, where you can choose between <strong>starting with a blank shard</strong> and do your own thing, or to <strong>make use of the default UOX3 world templates</strong> to generate decorations and provide a starting point for your shard.</p>
				  <p style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%"><img src="assets/images/uox3_welcome_1.jpg" style="padding: 20px;max-width: 50%; max-height: 316px;float: left"/><img src="assets/images/uox3_welcome_2.jpg" style="padding: 20px;max-width: 50%;max-height: 316px;float: right"/></p>
				  <p style="clear:both">If you don't want to make this choice on your first login, you can always return to the welcome screen using the <span class="highlight">'welcome</span> command, or alternatively skip that altogether and rely on the <span class="highlight">'decorate load</span> command to get the job done. Either way, any custom content you have added or changes you have made to your shard will not be overwritten.</p>
				  <p>For more info on how to actually create a character and login to your shard, check the <a href="#logInAndCreateChar">Logging In and Creating a Character</a> section of the docs.</p>
				  <h3>Populating your World with NPCs</h3>
				  <p>You can supplement the world decorations from above with a community-made spawn file, which <strong>will populate your world with all kinds of NPCs</strong>, from animals and monsters to shopkeepers and townfolk. This also covers mainland Britannia on the Felucca facet, as well as the dungeons and various monster camps on that map:</p>
					<h4>Community-made Spawn.dfn</h4>
					<p>Click the <span class="highlight">Community-made Spawn.dfn</span> link over at the <a href="https://www.uox3.org/downloads.shtml" target="_blank" title="UOX3.org Downloads page">UOX3.org Downloads-page</a> (<a href="https://www.uox3.org/files/community_made_spawns_v2.zip" title="UOX3.org Downloads - Community-made Spawns">direct link</a>) to download a zip-file with regional spawns setup to spawn a variety of NPCs across the Felcuca facet (world 0) of your UOX3 shard. Unzip this file into the <em>UOX3/dfndata/spawn/</em> folder, overwriting any existing (and presumably empty) spawn.dfn file in that folder.</p>
					<p><span class="highlight">Linux/MacOS users take note:</span> you might need to run the spawn file through dos2unix to convert the line breaks to the correct format for your platform, or UOX3 might not be able to read them properly. Just run the command "<span class="highlight">dos2unix *</span>" on the files before copying them into the UOX3/dfndata/spawn directory.</p>

						<p>Instead, either use the in-game GM command <span class="highlight">'shutdown #</span> (where # is the number of seconds until shutdown), or press <span class="highlight">*</span> in the UOX3 console to disable safe-mode, followed by either <span class="highlight">Q</span> or <span class="highlight">Esc</span>.

					<p>A couple of things are required to connect and login to your UOX3 shard; an <strong>Ultima Online</strong> client, and a <strong>tool that can remove encryption</strong> from said client. Such a tool is needed since UOX3 does not accept connections from encrypted clients.</p>
					<h3>Ultima Online</h3>
					<p>If you followed the recommendations in the Requirements section up above, you will already have an Ultima Online client installed, and can skip to the next step about Razor. If not - don't panic! Go grab the latest client download - titled <em>Classic Client</em> - from <a href="https://uo.com/client-download/" target="_blank" title="Official UO homepage - client download">the official UO website</a> and install it, or visit the UOX3 community forums to read more about different <a href="https://www.uox3.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=2289" target="_blank" title="UOX3 Community Forums - UO Client Compatibility">UO client versions/expansions and compatibility with UOX3</a>.</p>
					<h3>Removing the Client Encryption with Razor</h3>
					<p>With a UO client downloaded and installed, it's time to take care of the encryption. Go grab the <a href="http://www.uor-razor.com/" target="_blank" title="UO:R Community Edition of Razor">UO:R Community Edition of Razor</a> if you haven't already. It's being regularly maintained and updated, unlike the original Razor. Once you've got it unzipped (or installed, if there's an installer), <strong>right-click on Razor.exe</strong>, choose <strong>Properties</strong>, click the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab, and check the checkbox for "<em>Run this program in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 3)</em>". This, to avoid some potential issues with performance/client freezing on startup or login. Once done, <strong>start Razor</strong>!</p>
					<p>After a short wait, you'll be greeted by a welcome screen. Unless you encounter any issues, or you have multiple UO Client versions installed, just leave the <strong>Load Client</strong> part at <em>2D Client (Auto Detect)</em>. Make sure <strong>Patch client encryption</strong> is checked, and that the <strong>IP and Port</strong> matches what you setup for UOX3 in UOX.INI. If running client and server on same computer, the default UOX3 settings are <strong>127.0.0.1</strong> as IP and <strong>2593</strong> as Port.</p>
					<p>Once basic setup of Razor is complete, click the <strong>Okay</strong> button to launch the UO client. At this point you are now ready to enter your UOX3 username and password and log in!</p>
					<h3>Alternative for Linux/macOS users - Use ClassicUO Client</h3>
					<p>Note for <span class="highlight">Linux/macOS</span> (and even <span class="highlight">Windows</span>) users: An alternative to the regular UO client and Razor, neither of which run natively on Linux or macOS, is the <strong>ClassicUO</strong> client - an open-source, cross-platform client that can be used to connect to UOX3 without Razor - though it still requires the original UO data files to run, so you'll need to figure out a way to get those files over to your Linux/macOS machine.</p>

					<p>Once your UOX3 shard has successfully started up (and importantly, <strong>remains running</strong>), and the UO client has loaded the login screen after you started it using a tool like Razor, you are ready to log in to your UOX3 shard for the first time.</p>
					<p>Enter the same <span class="highlight">username</span> and <span class="highlight">password</span> that you added in <strong>UOX3/accounts/accounts.adm</strong> during the initial UOX3 setup, and click <span class="highlight">Login</span>.

					<p>Great! You have a character. Now what?</p>
					<p>If you're playing on the first account listed in <strong>UOX3\ACCOUNTS\accounts.adm</strong> (as you should), your characters will be classified as "admin" characters with automatic access to all Game Master and Admin powers and commands. However, the character doesn't quite look the part yet!</p>
					<h3>Becoming a GM</h3>
					<p>Let's start by turning your character into a proper Game Master. Type the following command into the UO client (don't forget the command prefix at the start of the command!):<br>
					<span class="highlight">'make gm</span></p>
					<p>Once you hit Enter, your regular UO mouse cursor (a hand) will be replaced by a targeting cursor, so go ahead and target your own character, who should now get a nice, new, shiny red GM robe, which also grants the awesome, ultimate destructive power of... being able to walk through doors. For admin characters, who already have access to all commands, this is more of a formality than anything else.</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_commandprefix">
					<label for="spoiler_commandprefix">Bonus Tip - Changing the Command Prefix <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>By default, the command prefix character used at the start of every GM command in UOX3 is set to '. You can change this command prefix via a setting called <span class="highlight">COMMANDPREFIX</span> in UOX.INI if you'd rather use something else.</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Changing Colour of GM Robe</h3>
					<p>Should you not be happy with the colour of your new robe, you can give it a facelift using the following command:<br>
					<span class="highlight">'dye</span></p>
					<p>Once you target your character - or any other <em>dynamic</em> object in the game world - a menu (referred to in UO as a GUMP) will pop up, allowing you to choose a colour to apply to the targeted object.</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_dynamicvsstatic">
					<label for="spoiler_dynamicvsstatic">Bonus Tip - Dynamic vs Static Items <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>Items you see in-game can usually be divided into two broad categories - <em>dynamic</em> and <em>static</em> items.</p>
						<p><strong>Static</strong> items are a permanent addition to the map, and can be seen even when logged into an otherwise empty shard. These items cannot be removed, modified or moved around without the use of specialized, 3rd party map-editing tools.</p>
						<p><strong>Dynamic</strong> items, on the other hand, are items you add to the game world, ones you can remove, move and manipulate. These are the decorations you place out, the doors that can be opened and the items in your backpack and equipped on your character's paperdoll. Some other emulators refer to these items (and characters) under the umbrella term <em>mobiles</em>.</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Becoming a Player Again</h3>
					<p>If you want to revert back to looking like a normal player, or if you want to strip another player of their GM powers, you can use this command to reverse the process (don't worry, as an admin you'll still retain all your GM powers!):<br>
					<span class="highlight">'make player</span></p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_makecns">
					<label for="spoiler_makecns">Bonus Tip - Counselors <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>The <strong>make</strong> command has a third variant, which allows you to assign someone as a Counselor for your shard. Like for GMs, the role of Counselor comes with a fancy robe, but a blue one instead of the GM's red:<br>
						<span class="highlight">'make cns</span></p>
						<p>Someone who has been made a Counselor will have access to some - but not all - GM powers, in particular those that involve responding to player help requests and travelling around the game world.</p>
						<p>As with the command to turn someone into a GM, be careful who you deal out such power to. Remember: Power tends to corrupt, and <em>absolute power corrupts absolutely!</em></p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
				  <div class="text-component">
					<p>Some of the most important GM commands to learn are the ones that allow you to traverse across Britannia and other realms in the blink of an eye, and the ones that provide you with information about where you are at any given point of time.</p>
					<p>The <span class="highlight">'where</span> command will show you the current in-game coordinates of your character, in the format of <strong>x, y, z, worldNumber, instanceID</strong>. If you walk around for a bit in the game, and use the command a couple more times, you might notice these coordinates changing. Before moving on to the next step, use <strong>where</strong> again, but this time make a note of the first three values. You'll need them soon!</p>
					<p>Next, as an exercise, try out the following GM commands to see what they do:<br>
					<span class="highlight">'tele</span><br>
					<span class="highlight">'travel</span> or <span class="highlight">'go</span><br>
					<span class="highlight">'goplace 1</span><br>
					<span class="highlight">'goplace 20</span></p>
					<p>Now that you have travelled the world, been places, maybe seen things you can never forget... it's time to return to your roots. Let's go back to the starting point, the location you were at when you used the <strong>where</strong> command earlier:<br>
					<span class="highlight">'go x y z</span> (replace x y and z with the values you got from the 'where command)</p>
					<p>UOX3 has <a href="#commandlist">many other commands</a> that allow you to manipulate the coordinates of both characters and items in various ways, but these basic few are your bread and butter, the ones you'll keep coming back to in order to get things done.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
				  <div class="text-component">
					<p>With the basics of travel commands under your belt already, it's time to move on to something a bit more interesting: Learning how to add objects like items and NPCs to your UOX3 shard! Your go-to tool for this will be the <strong>add</strong> command, which is a multi-purpose command that can be used in a variety of ways.</p>
					<h3>Adding Items via Add-menu</h3>
					<p>Let's jump right in using the following command:<br>
					<span class="highlight">'add</span></p>
					<p>A GUMP menu system should now pop up, listing items and NPCs categorized by function and purpose. Select <strong>"Gear"</strong> from the menu, then <strong>"Clothing"</strong> from the next sub-menu, then <strong>"Headwear"</strong>, before finally selecting <strong>"feathered hat"</strong>. This last selection will close the GUMP menu, and add the selected object - in this case a feathered hat - into your character's backpack.</p>
					<p>Open the backpack by double-clicking your character, then double-clicking the backpack in the character paperdoll that pops up, or by using the default UO shortcut key - <strong>alt+i</strong>. Next, click and drag the feathered hat out of your backpack and onto the character paperdoll to equip it. Congratulations! You are now a GM wearing a feathered hat.</p>
					<p>This "add-menu" can be used to add a variety of items to the game. Some are gear, like the feathered hat, some are decorations that you drag out of your backpack and place in the game-world somewhere, and some are tools or resources used by your character's skills - like a pickaxe for mining, or a hammer for blacksmithing.</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_allmove">
					<label for="spoiler_allmove">Bonus Tip - Moving Immovable Items <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>While adding items to your world, you might encounter a situation where the items you add won't highlight when you move your mouse cursor over them, and they cannot be picked up or dragged around, perhaps due to the item's <em>movable</em> state makes it immovable. The quickest way to overcome this issue is to use the following command, which will allow you to move all dynamic objects regardless of their immovable state:<br>
						<span class="highlight">'allmove on</span></p>
					</div>
					<h3>Adding NPCs via Add-menu</h3>
					<p>You can also add NPCs using the same command. Open the add-menu again using the same <span class="highlight">'add</span> command, and select <strong>"NPCs"</strong> from the menu. Next, select <strong>"Monsters"</strong>, followed by <strong>"Humanoids"</strong>, and finally <strong>"Orc"</strong>. A targeting cursor will be presented, and once you select a spot in the game world, an Orc will appear.</p>
					<p>Since you're a GM with unlimited power, you are by default invulnerable to damage, so the Orc won't even bother attacking you, but will just start wandering around aimlessly. However, should you wish to engage the Orc in a fight, you can disable your invulnerability through the <strong>make player</strong> command from earlier, or the following command:<br>
					<span class="highlight">'invul false</span></p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_resurrect">
					<label for="spoiler_resurrect">Bonus Tip - Resurrecting Players (or yourself) <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>If you bit off more than you could chew, and the Orc actually ended up killing your character, and you're now stuck in the bleak, grey realm of the dead - despair not! There's a command for that:<br>
						<span class="highlight">'resurrect</span></p>
						<p>Target the ghost of any dead player character using this command to instantly bring them back to life!</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Adding Items or NPCs Directly</h3>
					<p>Adding objects through the add-menu is all swell and good, but it can be a bit cumbersome and slow, especially if the items you need are nested deep inside some sub-menu! Thankfully there are faster ways of adding these objects. As long as you know the ID of the object you want to add, you can use the <strong>add</strong> command to add these objects directly without needing to slog through any menus!</p>
					<p>Try the following two commands:<br>
					<span class="highlight">'add item 0x171A</span><br>
					<span class="highlight">'add npc orc</span></p>
					<p>Both of the above examples should provide you with a targeting cursor to let you choose exactly where to add the item with ID 0x171a (feathered hat) or the NPC with id "orc" (Orc, duh). What if you don't know the ID of the object, though?</p>
					<p>To find the ID of an object that you want to add, you can either look it up in the DFN files under the <strong>UOX3\DFNDATA\ITEM</strong> or <strong>UOX3\DFNDATA\NPC</strong> folders, or you can use an in-game command that is also a powerful GM tool for adjusting the properties of objects - the <strong>tweak</strong> command.</p>
					<p>Try using this command to find the ID of the <strong>feathered hat</strong> or the <strong>Orc</strong> that you previously added:<br>
					<span class="highlight">'tweak</span></p>
					<p>Take note of the ID displayed in the GUMP menu that pops up, and compare it to the ID you supplied to the add command above.</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_removeobjects">
					<label for="spoiler_removeobjects">Bonus Tip - Removing Items and NPCs <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
					<p>Both items and NCPs can be removed using the <strong>remove</strong> command, which will bring up a targeting cursor to let you select which object to remove. Try it now, and target either the <strong>Orc</strong> or the <strong>feathered hat</strong> you previously dragged to your character's paperdoll:<br>
					<span class="highlight">'remove</span></p>
					<p>As soon as you target an object, said object will be instantly and permanently removed from view and deleted from the game world!</p>

					<p>What is covered in the previous few sections of this document just barely scratches the surface of all there is to learn, know and do in UOX3, and it would be impossible to cover everything without writing a long novel of an instruction manual.</p>
					<p>From here on out, it's up to <strong>you</strong> to really dig into the guts of UOX3 to <strong>explore</strong>, <strong>discover</strong>, <strong>learn</strong> and eventually <strong>grok UOX3 completely</strong>. Fret not, however! You still have tools like these your disposal to ease your journey:</p>
					<h3>The UOX3 Command List</h3>
					<p>The <a href="#commandList">command list</a> contains detailed information on each and every command available in UOX3.

					<h3>The Community Discord</h3>
					<p>Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/uBAXxhF" target="_blank" title="UOX3 Discord Server">UOX3 community on Discord</a> for a more direct line of communication with fellow UOX3 users and developers. Forums are great, but often it can be more efficient to have direct, near real-time conversations with other people.</p>

					<p>For additional colours, experiment with the numbers - or check out one of the tools that can show an overview of all the colours in the game, such as UOFiddler!</p>
					<h3>Partial-hues and Ethereal hues</h3>
					<p>Characters can be dyed with partial-hues, where only some parts of the character gets the selected colour, and other parts are left as the original colour. By adding <span class="highlight">0x8000</span> to a colour you want to apply to a character, the partial-hue flag for said character will be enabled in the client. For instance... if you use <span class="highlight">'dye 0x0279</span> on your human character, the entire character will receive that colour, including the loincloth. However, if you use <span class="highlight">'dye 0x8279</span> (0x0279 + 0x8000), only the body receives the colour, while the loincloth is left at its original colour!</p>
					<p>This applies to many other creatures in the game as well; with the partial-hue flag, a panther's eyes will remain glowing even if you dye the rest of the panther pink. A sheep's wool will stay white, even if the rest of the NPC is dyed green. Note that this only applies to characters - items don't support this partial-hue flag (although some items, like the jester suit, will only have some parts dyed by default).</p>
					<p>Similarly, you can make any creature look "ethereal" by giving it the hue <span class="highlight">0x4001</span> (actually, any hue between 0x4001 and 0x7fff should work, but they all look the same, so no point using anything else!). Example: <span class="highlight">'dye 0x4001</span> on a forest ostard NPC will turn it ethereal.</p>

					<h3>Maps and Statics</h3>
					<p>Upon startup, UOX3 will attempt to load map and statics files based on the parameters provided in <strong>UOX3/dfndata/maps/maps.dfn</strong>. It is important that the map sizes (in height and width) defined in this file match up to the actual files being loaded. Note that the default sizes match up with map files present in v5.0.0a and newer.</p>
					<p>To make UOX3 load maps of a different size, make sure to update the X and Y sizes in this file accordingly!</p>
					<h3>Tiledata</h3>
					<p><strong>UOX3/dfndata/maps/tiles.dfn</strong> allows overriding flags/properties stored in <strong>tiledata.mul</strong> for different tiles in UO, which UOX3 uses for various purposes such as determining whether a surface is walkable, climbable (ladders) or blocks line of sight. It is most commonly used to address various issues with tiles, such as missing or incorrect flags, without having to modify the tiledata.mul file itself.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq__trigger" href="#convertUOP" id="convertUOP"><span>(Bonus) Converting UOP to MUL</span></a>
				<div class="cd-faq__content">
				  <div class="text-component">
					<h3>Brief History of UOP Format</h3>
					<p>In UO Client v7.0.24.2, a new fileformat was introduced - UOP, that would eventually replace some of the files using the old MUL format. Amongst the files converted were the various <em>map*.mul</em> files, which became <em>map*LegacyMUL.uop</em> files. At the time, and before the different UO emulators (including UOX3) added support to load this new fileformat, prospective shard admins had to convert those .uop files <em>back</em> to .mul files before they could be used.</p>
					<p>Thankfully, creative souls came up with several tools that could be used to convert UO data files between these two file formats, for instance <a href="https://github.com/polserver/UOFiddler/releases" target="_blank" title="UOFiddler - viewer and editor of UO data files">UOFiddler</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cbnolok/LegacyMULConverter-N" target="_blank" title="LegacyMULConverter-N - a tool to convert MUL files to UOP">LegacyMULConverter-N</a>.</p>
					<h4>Conversion not Needed for UOX3 v0.99.3 and Above</h4>
					<p><strong>Do take note</strong>, that starting with <strong>UOX3 v0.99.3</strong>, these .uop files can be read by UOX3 directly <strong>without a need</strong> to convert them to back to the original format first. <strong>No need to convert!</strong> Should you for whatever reason still want to convert the map files back to .mul files, for instance to use them with an older version of UOX3, or to load them in a map-editing tool that doesn't support the newer format, here follows a quick guide on how you can do just that, using UOFiddler:</p>
					<h3>Step 1 - Backup UOP Files</h3>
					<p>Before doing anything else, locate your UO folder and <strong>copy all the .UOP files</strong> from that folder and into a new folder of your choice, so you don't mess with the original files in the UO client - just in case something goes horribly wrong.</p>
					<h3>Step 2 - Download UOFiddler</h3>
					<p>Second, download the latest version of UOFiddler from the link above, unzip it, and start UOFiddler.</p>
					<h3>Step 3 - Setup Data Paths in UOFiddler</h3>
					<p>Second, click <strong>Settings > Path Settings</strong> and make sure that the path to your UO folder is correct in the window that pops up. If you need to correct the path, use the <strong>Set path manual</strong> button and locate your UO folder.</p>
					<p>Next, hit <strong>Settings > Reload Files</strong> to have UOFiddler reload the data files from the path you selected.</p>
					<h3>Step 4 - Convert UOP Files to MUL</h3>
					<p>Once this is done, either use the small arrow buttons in the top right corner of UOFiddler to navigate to the <strong>far right tab called UOP Packer</strong>, or expand the size of the window until you see and can click that tab.</p>
					<p>Select the folder you copied the .UOP files into previously, using the file picker or by typing the path into the text-field, then select <strong>Extract UOP to MUL</strong> and hit <strong>Start</strong>.</p>
					<p>After around 15-30 seconds, UOFiddler should have finished converting the UOP files in your temporary folder to MUL files!</p>
					<div class="note"><p>Note that this process also works in reverse! If you have made any changes to the .mul files and want to convert them back to .uop to have them be read by the client, just follow the same procedure except choose <strong>Pack MUL to UOP</strong> in the last step instead!</p></div>

						<p>Disclaimer: This should not be considered as legal advice - it was not written by and is not the opinion or the advice of a lawyer</p>
						<p>Running an UOX3 shard, developing the UOX3 code, distributing the UOX3 program - all that is perfectly legal.

					<label for="spoiler_faq_connectionerror">Why am I getting connection-errors when trying to log in? <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>There can be a number of different reasons for why you are unable to connect to a UOX3 shard. Here are some of the most common ones:</p>
						<p><strong>You're trying to connect to UOX3 using an encrypted UO client</strong><br>
						Make sure you remove/patch away the UO client encryption through the use of <a href="https://github.com/markdwags/Razor" target="_blank" title="UO:R Community Edition of Razor">Razor</a> or a similar programs before trying to connect to a UOX3 shard. UOX3 will only accept clients with no encryption.</p>
						<p><strong>You set the IP and/or Port incorrectly in UOX.INI</strong><br>
						Having the wrong IP or Port in UOX.INI will give you a connection-error when you try to select the UOX3 shard in your client's server-list. The initial connection that checks for user-name/password might still go through, but not the server-selection part.</p>
						<p><strong>You set the IP and/or Port incorrectly in Razor/other tool used to start the client</strong><br>
						If you set the wrong IP to connect to in Razor/other tool you use to start the client, you will not be able to connect to the UOX3 shard at all, it will just give a connection-error immediately. If you set the correct IP but the wrong Port, you will be able to connect and verify your user-name/password, but will not be able to connect to the chosen server in the client's server-list.</p>
						<p><strong>The UO client computer's firewall is blocking outgoing connections</strong><br>
						The computer you're running the UO client on might be blocking outgoing connections, either through firewalls (like the built-in Windows firewall) or through 3rd-party security/antivirus-software. Try to disable whichever software might be blocking the outgoing connection temporarily to see if the connection is then allowed to go through, and/or include the UO client-executable and/or outgoing IP/Port in the exclusion-rules for these softwares.</p>

						The computer that's running the UOX3 software might be blocking incoming connections, either through software firewalls (like the built-in Windows firewall) or through 3rd-party security/antivirus-software.

						<p><strong>The UOX3 shard computer's router is not setup to forward incoming connections properly</strong><br>
						If you're trying to connect to the UOX3 shard from an external computer through the Internet, you might have to setup the UOX3 shard computer's Internet-router (if one is present) to forward incoming connections on the specified UOX3 port (2593 by default), to the internal LAN/local-IP of the UOX3 shard computer.</p>

					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>If NPCs aren't fighting back when you attack them, chances are that you are playing on either a GM character, or a character on the admin-account (which all have GM privileges by default). One of the privileges of being a GM (or an admin-character) is that you are flagged as "invulnerable" by default. Since NPCs (and players) can't attack invulnerable characters, this means they will never fight back when you try to attack them. In fact, UOX3 might not allow you to attack them at all.</p>
						<p>Try turning off your invulnerability by using either of these commands:</p>

					<label for="spoiler_faq_portforward">How do I setup Port Forwarding on my router? <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>If the server you intend to run your UOX3 shard on is behind a NAT router, then you might have to forward any incoming connections on port 2593 (or whichever other port you decided to use for UOX3) to the internal LAN-IP given to your server by the router. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia - Port Forwarding">Port Forwarding (Wikipedia)</a>, and whether or not it is required depends on the router and how it is setup. The easiest way to find out is to have someone try to connect to your UOX3 server over the Internet. If they are unable to connect, and you've ruled out all other options (mis-configuration of UOX3/UO Client, firewalls running on host/client computers, etc), then you might have to setup port-forwarding on your router.</p>
						<p>How do I do Port Forwarding?</p>
						<p>The exact procedure varies from router to router, but in general it involves connecting to the router's IP through your browser/Windows Explorer/Linux equivalent, entering the user-name and password required to log on to the router (these can either be default to the router-brand, or custom depending on your Internet-provider), and then adding the UOX3 port to whatever port-forwarding configuration exists for your router.</p>
						<p>Various sites on the World Wide Web include step-by-step instructions for how to setup port-forwarding on different types of routers. One such site is <a href="https://www.portforward.com/" target="_blank" title="PortForward.com - Guides on port forwarding">PortForward.com</a>. If the default username/password specific to your router (usually mentioned on these sites) is not working, you might have to consult the documentation that came along with the router, or contact your ISP to get them to provide the username and password.</p>
						<p>How can I check if I set it up correctly?</p>
						<p>To quickly check if you setup your port-forwarding correctly, you can visit <a href="https://canyouseeme.org/" target="_blank" title="CanYouSeeMee.org - tools for testing port-forwarding setup">CanYouSeeMe.org</a> (Open Port Check Tool) and just enter the port you're trying to forward. Click the 'check' button, and the tool should tell you whether or not it can see a service running on your server through said port.</p>
						<p>The other option is of course to have someone actually try to connect to your shard! :)</p>

					<p>The Advanced Trade System was originally created by <strong>Magius(CHE)</strong>, and can be used to set up a system with <strong>fluctuating prices</strong> for <strong>goods</strong> (items bought and sold by NPC vendors) across <strong>different regions</strong> of the game world. Every time the vendors restock their goods, the prices will be adjusted positively or negatively depending on a random range set for each type of good.</p>
					<p>By default, UOX3 comes with <strong>categories for goods</strong> already assigned to a multitude of items, ready to be used in the trade system, but you'll need to setup the regions portion of the system yourself. See list of Default Goods Categories below.</p>

					<h4>Item Setup</h4>
					<p>Each item to be affected by the fluctuating prices in the trade system need to have a <strong>value</strong> and a <strong>category of goods</strong> assigned to them in the item DFNs. This is done by adding the following tags to the items in question, if they're not already present:</p>
					<p><span class="highlight">value=buyPrice sellPrice</span> - base price of item when buying or selling from/to NPC vendors. Required for trade system to be able to make any adjustments to value of item!<br>
					<span class="highlight">good=goodCategory</span> - the category of goods to associated a given item with (see list above)</p>
					<h4>Region Setup</h4>
					<p>Once those tags have been added in the Item DFNs, the next step is to setup the various "regions" in regions.dfn. This is done by adding the following tags to the regions that should impact the trade system:</p>
					<p>
					<span class="highlight">good=goodCategory</span> - a category of goods (see list above) that the region should have an impact on the prices for. A region can affect multiple goods, and each such tag should be immediately followed by the following two tags:<br>
					<span class="highlight">buyable=#</span> / <span class="highlight"># #</span> - Fixed or random % modifier (accepts negative numbers) by which the baseValue of items belonging to the associated category of goods will be modified <strong>when bought</strong> from NPC vendors in the region.<br>
					<span class="highlight">sellable=#</span> / <span class="highlight"># #</span> - Fixed or random modifier value (accepts negative numbers) by which the baseValue of items belonging to the associated category of goods will be modified <strong>when sold</strong> to NPC vendors in the region.<br>
					<span class="highlight">randomvalue=#</span> Random modifier value (accepts negative numbers) by which the baseValue of items belonging to the associated category of goods will be modified when vendors restock the item.</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_advancedtrade_1">
					<label for="spoiler_advancedtrade_1">Trade System Example <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>A feathered hat (<strong>[0x171A]</strong> in headwear.dfn) is setup with <strong>value=27 13</strong> and <strong>good=20</strong> (the goods category for headwear). Normally, this item is sold by NPC vendors for 27 gold, and they'll buy the same item from players at a price of 13 gold.</p>
						<p>A region - for instance Britain - is setup with <strong>good=20</strong>, <strong>buyable=100</strong> (+10.0%) and <strong>sellable=-100</strong> (-10.0%) and finally <strong>randomvalue=-50 50</strong>.</p>
						<p>Meanwhile, another region - for instance Trinsic - is setup with <strong>good=20</strong>, <strong>buyable=-100</strong> (-10.0%) and <strong>sellable=1500</strong> (+150.0%) and finally <strong>randomvalue=-50 50</strong> (-5.0% to 5.0%).
						<p>A player goes to a tailor NPC in Britain, buys a feathered hat for a price of 27 * 1.1 (+10.0%) = 30 gold, then heads off to Trinsic, where they sell the feathered hat to another tailor NPC for the price of 13 * 2.5 (+150.0%) = 33 gold. Profit! The player then makes the mistake of buying another feathered hat in Trinsic for the price of 27 * 0.9 (-10.0%) = 24 gold, heads back to Britain and sells it to the vendor there for 13 * 0.9 (-10.0%) = 12 gold! Ouch.</p>
						<p>A little while later, the vendors restock their goods, and <strong>randomvalue=-50 50</strong> kicks in and adjusts the overall price of feathered hats by +5% in Britain and -3% in Trinsic. Feathered hats can now be bought and sold in Britain for 28 gold and 14 gold respectively, while they go for 26 gold and 13 gold respectively in Trinsic. The selling price in Trinsic remains the same, because an adjustment of -3% is not enough to overcome the powers of rounding (12.61 gold = 13).</p>

					<p><em>Advancement Gates is a concept in UOX3 that allows you to set up automated shortcuts for giving players a boost to stats, skills and items in-game without GM intervention. They can for instance be used to create custom class templates beyond what is offered during character creation in the client, can be used for events where you'd like to give players some special items, and can even be combined with another concept such as <strong>Monster Gates</strong> and the <strong>Race System</strong> to allow players to take on the roles of monsters on your shard.</em></p>
					<div class="note"><p style="color: black; font-style: italic">Note: Although they're called advancement "gates", they can actually be any object the player is able to walk onto/collide with!</p></div>

					<h3>Setting Up an Advancement Gate</h3>
					<p>To actually set up an advancement gate in-game, there are two paths you can take. You can either add them by hand, in-game, using GM commands, or you can set up predefined items in the item DFNs that can be quickly added anywhere at any time with a single GM command. Let's look at each option.</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_advance_2">
					<label for="spoiler_advance_2">Manual Setup <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p><strong>1)</strong> Add a gate item (or another item players can walk over) where you want your advancement gate to be.<br>
						<p style="margin-left: 20px">For a blue moongate, try <span class="highlight">'add 0x0f6c</span><br>
						For a red moongate, use <span class="highlight">'add 0x0dda</span></p>
						<p>You can also dye these a different color using the <span class="highlight">'dye</span> command.</p>
						<p><strong>2a)</strong> If you want players to only able to make use of the advancement gate a single time, use <span class="highlight">'set type 80</span> and targeting the gate to set it up as a "single use" advancement gate.</p>
						<p><strong>2b)</strong> Alternatively, use <span class="highlight">'set type 81</span> to make it a "multiple use" advancement gate that can be used over and over again.</p>
						<p><strong>3)</strong> Use <span class="highlight">'set morex #</span> to point the advancement gate to a unique identifier already setup in advance.dfn (see above). For example, <strong>'set morex 1</strong> would assign the [ADVANCEMENT 1] gate setup from advance.dfn to the item, and players stepping onto the gate will become a Master Smith, based on the example from above.</p>
						<p><strong>4)</strong> To make sure your gate item doesn't vanish into thin air, use the <span class="highlight">'nodecay</span> command on it to stop it from decaying.</p>
						<p><strong>5)</strong> To make sure your players can't pick it up and run away with it, use the <span class="highlight">'set movable 3</span> command on it.</p>
						<p><strong>6)</strong> Finally, use the <span class="highlight">'tweak</span> command on the gate to give it an identifying name so players can tell what it is if they click on it.</p>
					</div>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_advance_3">
					<label for="spoiler_advance_3">Predefined Item Setup <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>If you want to create re-usable definitions (templates, if you will) for advancement gates that let you quickly add them in multiple areas without having to set up each one from scratch, you can add items like this to a custom .dfn file inside the DFNDATA/ITEMS/ folder:</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 20px">
						<span class="highlight">[adv_gate_mastersmith]</span> Name of custom item<br>
						<span class="highlight">{</span><br>
						<span class="highlight">get=base_item</span> Inherit basic item properties from base item so we don't have to re-add them here<br>
						<span class="highlight">name=Master Smith Advancement Gate</span> Name that shows when players click on the gate<br>
						<span class="highlight">id=0x0f6c</span> ID of the item to be used as a gate; a blue moongate in this example<br>
						<span class="highlight">type=80</span> Sets item to "single use advancement gate" itemType (use 81 for multi-use gates)<br>
						<span class="highlight">morex=1</span> Assigns the advancement ID from advance.dfn<br>
						<span class="highlight">decay=0</span> Makes item not decay<br>
						<span class="highlight">movable=3</span> Makes item immovable<br>
						<span class="highlight">}</span></p>
						<p>For each advancement gate setup you have in advance.dfn, set up one such item definition. Once done, either restart UOX3 or reload DFNs using the UOX3 console menu (press <span class="highlight">*</span> to deactivate safe mode, followed by <span class="highlight">7</span> to reload DFNs or <strong>?</strong> to see menu).</p>
						<p>The next time you log into your shard, you can use the following GM command to add your custom advancement gate item anywhere you want:</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">'add item adv_gate_mastersmith</span> (replace name with name you give your custom gate item)</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
				  <div class="text-component">
					<p>The core of the crafting system in UOX3 is setup in a series of DFN files, usually one per crafting skill, that all exist in the <strong>UOX3/dfndata/create/</strong> folder. Each of these files contain a number of references to <em>menus</em>, <em>submenus</em>, <em>items</em> and <em>resources</em>, which altogether are used by UOX3 to create the <strong>in-game crafting menus</strong> you see when using the appropriate crafting tools and skills.</p>
					<h3>Sub Menu:</h3>
					<p>When interpreting these files and creating the in-game crafting menus, UOX3 starts by looking up the first <span class="highlight">[SUBMENU #]</span> section it can find, and by default that can be found in smithing.dfn, and looks like this:</p>

					</div>
					<p>Note: The ID used for a SUBMENU section must be unique (<em>across all create DFN files</em>), and the same is true for the other menu-specific sections in the create DFN system, like <strong>MENUENTRY</strong> and <strong>ITEM</strong> (see below).</p>
					<h3>Menu Entry</h3>
					<p>The above sub-menu contains three <span class="highlight">MENU entries</span> - for armor, shields and weapons respectively - which are references to <span class="highlight">[MENUENTRY #]</span> sections defined in the same file. Here's an example of one of them, for shields:</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_menuentry_section">

						NAME=Shields<br>
						ID=0x1b74<br>
						SUBMENU=3<br>
						}</span></p>
					</div>
					<p>Each such <strong>[MENUENTRY #]</strong> section contains both an item ID (for an item that is displayed to represent an "item/menu category" in the crafting menu), and another SUBMENU reference.

					<p>These entries refer directly to <span class="highlight">[ITEM #]</span> sections defined further down in the same file, which contain all the requirements needed to craft an item, as well as various item properties that will be assigned to the crafted item after it has been made, such as colour, rank, etc. An example, let's look at the item referenced by the ITEM=2 entry:</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_item_section">
					<label for="spoiler_item_section">[ITEM 2] <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p><span class="highlight">[ITEM 2]<br>
						{<br>
						NAME=bronze<br>
						ID=0x1b72<br>
						RESOURCE=0x1bf2 12<br>
						SKILL=7 0 150<br>
						ADDITEM=0x1b72<br>
						MINRANK=1<br>
						MAXRANK=10<br>
						SOUND=0x002A<br>
						}</span></p>
					</div>
					<p>When one of these ITEM entries are selected in the crafting menu, UOX3 first checks that the player <strong>meets the crafting requirements</strong> as defined in the ITEM section, <strong>allows or denies</strong> the crafting attempt, and then returns either a failure or success to the player based on a <strong>combination of skill-checks and random luck</strong>.</p>
					<p>Success will cause the defined amount of resources to be consumed as part of the crafting process, and in return the player is given the final crafted item. Failure will cause a small amount of resources to go to waste, with no crafted item being given to the player.</p>
					<h3>Resource Types</h3>
					<p>Named resource types such as <span class="highlight">WOOD</span>, <span class="highlight">LEATHER</span> or <span class="highlight">CLOTH</span> can be used as resource requirements instead of direct references to specific resource IDs. This allows for a setup where crafting particular items can be done using <em>any resource ID</em> that belongs to a given, named resource type, rather than being restricted to any one particular resource ID.<p>
					<p>For instance, instead of saying <em>"this item requires a resource with <strong>ID 0x175d</strong> (folded cloth) to craft"</em>, which would make it impossible to craft the same item using a similar resource with ID 0x1768 (cut cloth), we can say "this item requires a resource of type <strong>CLOTH</strong> to craft". As an example, <span class="highlight">RESOURCE=CLOTH 12</span> would allow a player to craft an item using any CLOTH resource.</p>
					<p>The named resource types, and the resource IDs that fit in under those types, are defined in <strong>UOX3/dfndata/create/resources.dfn</strong>. Here's an example of the CLOTH resource type from that file:</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_resource_definition">
					<label for="spoiler_resource_definition">[RESOURCE CLOTH] <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p><span class="highlight">[RESOURCE CLOTH]<br>
						{<br>
						ID=0x175d<br>
						ID=0x175e<br>
						ID=0x175f<br>
						ID=0x1760<br>
						ID=0x1761<br>
						ID=0x1762<br>
						ID=0x1763<br>
						ID=0x1764<br>
						ID=0x1765<br>
						ID=0x1766<br>
						ID=0x1767<br>
						ID=0x1768<br>
						}</span></p>
					</div>
					<p>Any and all of the above listed resource IDs will be counted as CLOTH by the crafting system, allowing for a much more flexible and user-friendly crafting process!</p>
					<h3>Create DFN Tags</h3>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_create_tags">
					<label for="spoiler_create_tags">Create DFN Tags explained <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p><span class="highlight">MENU</span> - menu-system tag that points to a MENUENTRY section.<br>
						<span class="highlight">SUBMENU</span> - menu-system tag that points to a SUBMENU section.<br>
						<span class="highlight">ITEM</span> - menu-system tag that points to an ITEM section.<br>
						<span class="highlight">NAME</span> - the label applied to the item when shown in the crafting menu, which is not necessarily a reflection of the name of the actual item that will be crafted in the end.<br>
						<span class="highlight">ID</span> - the artwork ID used to display the item in the crafting menu.<br>
						<span class="highlight">RESOURCE</span> - contains the ID and/or resource type (see below) of the resource required to craft the item, as well as optional amount and colour values. In this case the colour tag is omitted, but the amount is specified, so 12 items with the ID 0x1bf2 (and the colour 0) are required to craft this item. Each item entry can contain multiple RESOURCE tags, if more than one type of resource is required to craft an item.<br>
						<span class="highlight">SKILL</span> - the skill ID of a skill required to craft the item, along with minimum (minimum skill-points to be able to attempt crafting the item) and maximum (skill-points higher than which player will always succeed) skill-point values. Each item entry can contain multiple SKILL tags, if more than one skill is required to craft an item.<br>
						<span class="highlight">ADDITEM</span> - the tag pointing to the [section header] name of the actual item that will be crafted, as defined in the item DFNs in UOX3/dfndata/items/<br>
						<span class="highlight">MINRANK</span> - represents the minimum item rank that can be randomly applied to the crafted item based on the rank system, which can cause items to become weaker or stronger than average.<br>
						<span class="highlight">MAXRANK</span> - represents the maximum item rank that can be randomly applied to the crafted item based on the rank system, which can cause items to become weaker or stronger than average. If rank system is off, the default rank value is 10.<br>
						<span class="highlight">SOUND</span> - the sound FX that plays when the item is being crafted.</p>
						<p>In addition, there are some supported tags not used in the above example:<br>
						<span class="highlight">DELAY</span> - the delay in milliseconds before the crafting process completes and the item has been crafted.<br>
						<span class="highlight">SPELL</span> - the spell ID of a spell required to be in the player's possession (in a spellbook) in order to craft the item. Primarily used by the Inscription skill.<br></p>
					</div>
					<h3>Rank System</h3>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_rank_system">
					<label for="spoiler_rank_system">Advanced Topic: Rank System <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>The rank system is an extension of the crafting system that calculates a "quality rank" for crafted items based on a player's average skill in all skills required to craft the item, and on the <strong>MINRANK</strong> and <strong>MAXRANK</strong> tags of the item's entry in the create DFNs, which by default ranges from <strong>1 to 10</strong>. Depending on the calculated rank, a modifier is applied to some of the item's base properties. The system can be enabled/disabled via the <span class="highlight">RANKSYSTEM=1/0</span> setting in UOX.INI.</p>
						<p>The <strong>item properties</strong> affected by the rank system, if enabled:<br>
							<span class="highlight">lodamage/hidamage</span><br>
							<span class="highlight">ar/physical resist</span><br>
							<span class="highlight">hp/maxhp</span><br>
							<span class="highlight">buyvalue/sellvalue/</span></p>
						<p>These properties are modified according to the following formula:<br>
						<span class="highlight">newPropertyVal = (( rank * propertyVal ) / 10 )</span></p>
						<p>Thus, an item with a calculated final rank of 10 will not be modified, while any rank below 10 will reduce the values of the above properties for the item by -10% per rank below 10.</p>
						<p>Calculation of rank takes place as part of the crafting process. First, a <strong>range of potential ranks</strong> is determined based on the values of the MINRANK and MAXRANK tags for an item in the create DFNs. Then, <strong>for each skill</strong> required to craft the item, the system <strong>calculates a temporary rank</strong> based on the player's skill, random chance, and a UOX.INI setting (<span class="highlight">SKILLLEVEL=5</span>) which acts as a global modifier to the system to make it <strong>easier</strong> (low SKILLLEVEL value) to get high rank items, or <strong>harder</strong> (high SKILLLEVEL value) to get high rank items.</p>
						<p>When a temporary rank has been calculated for all skills required to craft the item, the average of all these is chosen as the item's final rank, and the modifiers are permanently applied to the item's properties.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
				  <div class="text-component">
					<p>UOX3 comes with a <strong>custom dictionary system</strong> that allows shard admins to set up and translate their own system and script messages to any language supported by the UO client. This system has some pros and cons over the usual "cliloc" (client localization, also supported!) system UO uses, in that it allows shard admins to send completely customized messages to the client (even if not setting up for multiple languages), at the cost of using more bandwith than the built-in cliloc system in the client.</p>
					<p>The dictionaries are set up in the <em>UOX3/dictionaries/</em> folder, with each language contained in its own dictionary file with a file-ending matching a <strong>group</strong> of language codes used in the UO client. ENG, for instance, covers all English language codes, and FRE does the same for French ones. The exceptions are the files with a .ZRO and .UNK extensions. These are used as default files when no/an unknown language is returned from the client.</p>
					<h4>Language Groups supported in UOX3's Dictionary System:</h4>
					<p><span class="highlight">UNK</span> (Unknown - Used when unknown language code is returned from client)<br>
					<span class="highlight">ZRO</span> (Default - Used )<br>
					<span class="highlight">ENG</span> (English - ENU, ENG, ENA, ENC, ENZ, ENI, ENS, ENJ, ENB, ENL, ENT, ENW, ENP)<br>
					<span class="highlight">GER</span> (German - DEU, DES, DEA, DEL, DEC)<br>
					<span class="highlight">SPA</span> (Spanish - ESP, ESM, ESN, ESG, ESC, ESA, ESD, ESV, ESO, ESR, ESS, ESF, ESL, ESY, ESZ, ESB, ESE, ESH, ESI, ESU)<br>
					<span class="highlight">FRE</span> (French - FRA, FRB, FRC, FRS, FRL, FRM)<br>
					<span class="highlight">JAP</span> (Japanese - JPN)<br></p>
					<h4>Language Codes supported by UO client via cliloc system (depending on client version):</h4>
					<p><span class="highlight">ENG</span> (English)<br>
					<span class="highlight">DEU</span> (German)<br>
					<span class="highlight">ESP</span> (Spanish)<br>
					<span class="highlight">FRA</span> (French)<br>
					<span class="highlight">CHT</span> (Chinese)<br>
					<span class="highlight">CHS</span> (Non-Traditional Chinese)<br>
					<span class="highlight">JPN</span> (Japanese)<br>
					<span class="highlight">KOR</span> (Korean)<br></p>
					<p>In older client versions, it is possible to change the client language by changing a setting - <strong>UserLanguageCodeString</strong> - in the uo.cfg file. <strong>Example: UserLanguageCodeString=DEU</strong>. In modern client versions, this seems to instead be dictated automatically by the regional settings in Windows, meaning the above uo.cfg setting might not work.</p>
					<p>Alternatively, it's also possible to set a specific language for a player's socket either through a script (for instance via a custom menu that could allow players to choose which language to use) or via the GM command <span class="highlight">'set language #</span>. See below for a full list of language IDs that can be set in this manner:</p>

					<h3>Customizable Ore Types</h3>
					<p>The different types of ore a player can mine are defined at the bottom of skills.dfn, in a section called <span class="highlight">[ORE_LIST]</span>. Shard admins can easily add or remove ore types to/from this list.</p>

						<p>Note that the sum total of all <strong>ORECHANCE</strong> values for all ore types (including ones not listed in this example) does not <strong>have</strong> to add up to <strong>1000</strong>, but doing that makes it easier to conceptualize the chance to mine each ore type: <strong>500</strong> becomes <span class="highlight">50.0%</span>, <strong>112</strong> becomes <span class="highlight">11.2%</span>, etc. Compare to a setup where the values all add up to 750 instead: 500 becomes (500/750)*100 = <strong>~66.67%</strong>, 112 becomes (112/750)*100 = <strong>~14.9%</strong>. Not so straight forward to calculate in the head!</p>

					<h3>Region-based Ore Preferences</h3>
					<p>By default, the <strong>MINECHECK=1</strong> setting in uox.ini allows players to mine any ore from any mountain anywhere, as long as they meet the minimum skill requirement for mining a given type of ore. This means, however, that skilled miners can mine the most valuable ores from any old mountain/cave, even if it's just outside the safe zone of a major city.</p>
					<p>However, the <span class="highlight">OREPREF</span> tag supported by the Region system gives shard admins some extra control over where players can find the various ore types.
					<p>For instance, the types of ore a player will find in a given region (UOX3/dfndata/regions/regions.dfn) can be regulated by attaching to those regions one or more <span class="highlight">OREPREF=[oreType,oreChanceWeight]</span> tags - one per ore type to be found in the region, where <strong>oreType</strong> is one of the ores listed in [ORE_LIST] section, and <strong>oreChanceWeight</strong> is a weighted value from 0 to ~1000 indicating the chance to find that ore type in the region relative to other available ore types.</p>

					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>This is an example of a custom region setup in UOX3/dfndata/regions/regions.dfn with ore preferences that control what type of ore a player can find in the region, and what the likelihood of finding each ore is:</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">
						[REGION 12]<br>
						{<br>
						NAME=the town of Minoc<br>
						MUSICLIST=6<br>
						GUARDED=1<br>
						GUARDLIST=guard<br>
						GUARDOWNER=The Town<br>
						MAGICDAMAGE=1<br>
						MARK=1<br>
						GATE=1<br>
						RECALL=1<br>
						ESCORTS=1<br>
						X1=2395<br>
						Y1=430<br>
						X2=2555<br>
						Y2=573<br>
						...<br>
						X1=2485<br>
						Y1=650<br>
						X2=2575<br>
						Y2=695<br>
						OREPREF=DullCopper,500<br>
						OREPREF=Verite,300<br>
						OREPREF=Valorite,150<br>
						OREPREF=Iron,50<br>
						}</span></p>
						<p>The four <span class="highlight">OREPREF</span> tags in this example have values of 500, 300, 150 and 50, that by happy coincidence sums up to a total of 1000 (not a requirement, but makes calculating chance for each ore easier in one's brain). If we divide each of those values by the sum total and multiply the result by 100, we get the percentage chance for mining each of the ore types, given that the player has high enough skill. Example:</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<strong>Sum Total:</strong><br>
								<li>1000 = ((1000 / 1000)*100) = <span class="highlight">100%</span></li>
								<strong>Ore chances:</strong><br>
								<li>500 = ((500 / 1000)*100) = <span class="highlight">50%</span> of finding dull copper ore</li>
								<li>300 = ((300 / 1000)*100) = <span class="highlight">30%</span> of finding verite ore</li>
								<li>150 = ((150 / 1000)*100) = <span class="highlight">15%</span> of finding valorite ore</li>
								<li>50 = ((50 / 1000)*100) = <span class="highlight">5%</span> of finding iron ore</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>Note that for this example, players would only be able to find <strong>dull copper</strong>, <strong>verite</strong>, <strong>valorite</strong> and <strong>iron</strong> ores in this region, as there are no OREPREF tags present for any other ore types.</p>
						<p>It is recommended to include an OREPREF for an ore type (like iron) that can be mined by anyone regardless of skill, so players who go to a region with OREPREFs setup can still mine something useful!</p>
					</div>
					<p>Note that if <strong>no OREPREF tags</strong> are present in a region, UOX3 will use the default chance defined for each ore type in skills.dfn to determine what type of ore the player will find when mining there. If <strong>no default chance</strong> is specified for the ore types, <strong>all</strong> ore types will have equal chance of being mined in a given region.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
				  <div class="text-component">
					  <h3>Escort Quest System</h3>
						<p>NPC Escort Quests allow players to earn a bit of extra gold by escorting NPCs from one location to another (gold paid upon safe arrival in a specified target region)! Basically, dedicated spawners are used to spawn quest NPCs that can be escorted. At the same time, quest messages are automatically posted in any bulletin board in the same region as the spawner, with details on the quest, the quest NPC and the target destination.</p>
						<p>The Escort Quest system is controlled via a few settings in <strong>UOX.INI</strong>:</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">[escorts]<br>
						{<br>
						ESCORTENABLED=1<br>
						ESCORTINITEXPIRE=900<br>
						ESCORTACTIVEEXPIRE=600<br>
						ESCORTDONEEXPIRE=600<br>
						}</span></p>
						<p><span class="highlight">ESCORTENABLED</span> is used to enable (1) or disable (1) the system, while <span class="highlight">ESCORTINITEXPIRE</span> is the amount of time (in seconds) a quest NPC will wait for someone to initiate the quest, before vanishing. <span class="highlight">ESCORTACTIVEEXPIRE</span> is the amount of time (in seconds) a player has available to bring the quest NPC to its desired destination before the quest is aborted. Finally, <span class="highlight">ESCORTDONEEXPIRE</span> is the time in seconds until a quest NPC will vanish after having successfully reached its destination.</p>
						<h3>Escort Quest NPCs</h3>
						<p>To actually spawn the quest NPCs required by the Escort Quest system, you need to setup and place out some <strong>Escort NPC Spawners</strong>. These are special spawner objects of type that are only active if the escort quest system itself is active via the above mentioned ini setting. For additional instructions on how to setup these spawners, please refer to the <a href="#itemtypes" title="UOX3 Documentation - Item Types">list of item types</a> in UOX3, and follow the steps provided there for type <span class="highlight">125 - IT_ESCORTNPCSPAWNER</span>. Once one of these spawners has been setup, it can be duplicated into many copies using a command like <span class="highlight">'dupe 50</span>, and then placed in areas where quest NPCs should spawn.</p>
						<h3>Escort Quest Rewards</h3>
						<p>The rewards for completing an escort quest are based partly on a given quest NPC's fame, and partly on the amount of gold they're carrying. This setup provides some flexibility for how shard admins want to handle the NPC escorts and associated rewards. For instance, one could setup a Nobleman with high fame (but little gold), a merchant with low fame (but a lot of gold), or an adventurer (with random amount of fame and random amount of gold). The formulate used to calculate the final reward given to the player looks like this: <span class="highlight">rewardAmount = (( totalFame / 100 ) * 50 ) + ( totalGold * 0.25 )</span></p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
				  <div class="text-component">
					<p>Slaying monsters is all well and good, but surprisingly, most adventurers are not satisfied with just the feeling of ridding the world of evil; they desire something much more valuable: <strong>Epic Loot</strong>! To give NPCs in UOX3 some of this precious and much-sought-after loot, a couple of methods are at your disposal:</p>
					<h4>GOLD tag in NPC DFNs</h4>
					<p>The GOLD tag will, when present in the definition for an NPC, add a fixed or random amount of gold to said NPC's backpack when they spawn. This gold will end up on the NPC's corpse when slain, unless it's stolen by a rogue before then! Examples of usage:</p>
					<p><span class="highlight">GOLD=50</span> - Adds 50 gold to NPC backpack<br>
					<span class="highlight">GOLD=50 100</span> - Adds between 50 to 100 gold to NPC backpack</p>
					<h4>PACKITEM/LOOT tags in NPC DFNs</h4>
					<p>The PACKITEM or LOOT DFN tags can be used to add items to a NPC's backpack when spawned. The PACKITEM tag can either point to specific items, or to itemlists (<strong>UOX3/dfndata/items/itemlists/itemlists.dfn</strong>) from which random items will be selected. The LOOT tag, meanwhile, can only point to specific type of itemlists called lootlists (<strong>UOX3/dfnata/items/lootlists.dfn</strong>), from which random items will be selected. Both tags support an extra, comma-separated parameter that determines the amount of items to add. Some examples:</p>
					<p>
					<span class="highlight">PACKITEM=0x0ff0</span> - Adds a book with a specific ID to backpack<br>
					<span class="highlight">PACKITEM=0x0eed,50</span> - Adds 50 gold to backpack<br>
					<span class="highlight">PACKITEM=listobject6</span> - Adds a random music instrument from itemlist that listobject6 points to<br>
					<span class="highlight">LOOT=reagents</span> - Adds a random reagent from reagents lootlist to backpack<br>
					<span class="highlight">LOOT=reagents,3</span> - Adds 3 random reagents from the same lootlist as loot<br></p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_lootlists">
					<label for="spoiler_lootlists">Itemlists and Lootlists Explained <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>In the above example, <strong>LOOT=reagents</strong> points to a lootlist called reagents, configured in <strong>UOX3/dfndata/items/lootlists.dfn</strong>, which consists of a list of items from which UOX3 will randomly select one or more items - depending on whether or not an amount was specified with the LOOT tag. The lootlist in question:</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">[LOOTLIST reagents]<br>
						{<br>
						0x0f7a<br>
						0x0f7b<br>
						0x0f84<br>
						0x0f85<br>
						0x0f86<br>
						0x0f88<br>
						0x0f8c<br>
						0x0f8d<br>
						}</span></p>
						<p>Adding <span class="highlight">LOOT=reagents,3</span> in the NPC definition of an orc would add 3 random reagents from the reagents lootlist to that orc when spawned.</p>
						<p>In the above example, each and every orc in the game would have 3 random reagents in their inventory, <em>every time</em>. However, what if you only wanted the orcs to have reagents as loot some of the time, not all the time?</p>
						<h4>Blank Lootlist Entries</h4>
						<p>For additional control over drop-rates, a special entry is supported in lootlists, called "<span class="highlight">blank</span>" (without the quotation marks). If UOX3 selects one of these special entries when making a random selection from a lootlist, it will interpret this as if no item should be spawned. Example:</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">[LOOTLIST reagents]<br>
						{<br>
						0x0f7a<br>
						0x0f7b<br>
						0x0f84<br>
						0x0f85<br>
						0x0f86<br>
						0x0f88<br>
						0x0f8c<br>
						0x0f8d<br>
						blank<br>
						blank<br>
						}</span></p>
						<p>Any call to the above lootlist would have a 8/10 or 80% chance of spawning a reagent as loot, and a 2/10 or 20% chance of spawning nothing. Insert or remove such blank lines as needed to get your desired drop-rate for a given lootlist!</p>
						<h4>What about Itemlists? How do they differ from lootlists?</h4>
						<p>While lootlists serve only a specific purpose - adding loot to an NPC's backpack, the more general itemlists are multi-purpose, and are used in a variety of features in UOX3, such as when adding newbie items for freshly created player characters, by region spawners when spawning random items in specific regions of the game world.</p>
						<p>Like lootlists, itemlists support the special "blank" entry, but unlike lootlists, items from itemlists can also be added directly in-game by GMs, using the <strong>'add item [itemlist]</strong> command. Example: <span class="highlight">'add item listobject6</span> will add a random musical instrument in-game.</p>
						<p>Itemlists are setup in pairs of lists and objects. Example:</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">//Instruments<br>
						[ITEMLIST 6]<br>
						{<br>
						0x0e9c<br>
						0x0e9d<br>
						0x0e9e<br>
						0x0eb1<br>
						0x0eb2<br>
						0x0eb3<br>
						0x0eb4<br>
						}<br><br>
						// Instruments<br>
						[listobject6]<br>
						{<br>
						itemlist=6<br>
						}</span></p>
						<p>Instead of referring to the itemlist directly, one refers to an object associated with the itemlist, which in the above example would be <span class="highlight">listobject6</span>, which then refers to the specified itemlist.</p>
					</div>
					<h4>onDeath JS Event</h4>
					<p>For a more custom approach to NPC loot, with more control over what kind of items drop and under which circumstances, you can make use the JS Event onDeath in a script attached to an NPC, which triggers for NPCs upon death and lets you defined your own rules for what should happen. For more information on how to setup JS scripts, check the <a href="#scriptingJS">Scripting - JS Engine</a> section of this document!</p>

				<a class="cd-faq__trigger" href="#npcMovement" id="npcMovement"><span>NPC Movement and Pathfinding</span></a>
				<div class="cd-faq__content">
				  <div class="text-component">
					<h3>WanderModes Overview</h3>
					<p>The movement of NPCs in UOX3 is largely controlled by a property of NPCs called <strong>wanderMode</strong>. This property can be controlled to some degree through NPC setup in the DFNs (more on that below), but it's also dynamically altered at run-time based on the state of the NPC and what they're supposed to be doing.</p>
					<p>For instance, a player's pet who is given the pet command "<em>follow me</em>", will have its wanderMode altered to <strong>follow</strong> (<strong>wanderMode 1</strong>), and will follow that player until another command is used or another event takes place that cause its wanderMode to be altered.</p>
					<p>An Orc that sees and wants to attack a player also goes into the follow wanderMode, and will attempt to follow the player until they get into range and can perform their attack. However, should the player deal enough damage to the Orc, it might instead enter the <strong>flee</strong> wanderMode (<strong>wanderMode 6</strong>) and try to escape with its life.</p>
					<p>Another wanderMode - <strong>pathfind</strong> (<strong>wanderMode 7</strong>) - is a temporary wanderMode set by UOX3 that functions similarly to the follow mode, but instead of continuing to follow someone indefinitely, it stops and reverts back to its original wanderMode (whatever that might be) when it reaches the intended target (or if it fails to pathfind there).</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_npcwander_pathfinding">
					<label for="spoiler_npcwander_pathfinding">Basic vs Advanced (A*) Pathfinding <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>By default, the <strong>advanced pathfinding</strong> setting is enabled for NPCs in UOX3. This mode of pathfinding utilizes the popular A* algorithm to find the shortest paths NPCs need to take in order to reach their intended location. This setting can be enabled or disabled via the <span class="highlight">ADVANCEDPATHFINDING</span> flag in UOX.INI, though it is recommended to leave this setting enabled unless experiencing performance drops due to too many/too heavy pathfinding calculations.</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Controlling NPC WanderMode through DFNs</h3>
					<p>Some of these wanderModes are used almost exclusively by UOX3's internal code (like the pathfind and follow modes), while others can be set as default modes for NPCs in the DFNs via the <strong>npcwander</strong> DFN tag. Let's look at the most common options for that tag:</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px"><span class="highlight">npcwander=0</span> (None)<br>
					The most basic of wanderModes. Essentially, the NPC has no default mode of movement and will stand still on the spot after spawning until something causes its wanderMode to be altered (like being attacked). Once such an event stand, they once again become motionless.</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px"><span class="highlight">npcwander=2</span> (Free)<br>
					The popular wanderMode for free-spirited NPCs who like to roam wherever the wind takes them. NPCs with this wanderMode will move around randomly, with no restrictions on direction or distance. There's no saying where they'll end up!</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px"><span class="highlight">npcwander=3</span> (Box)<br>
					NPCs with this wanderMode are unable to 'think outside the box'. The box is their entire life; if there's a world beyond the box, the NPC either doesn't know about it - or doesn't care! However, if provoked, they might leave their box for a limited time, before returning should the situation calm down. This wanderMode requires some additional setup (see below).</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_npcwander_box">
					<label for="spoiler_npcwander_box">Additional Setup for Box WanderMode <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>Usage of the "box" wanderMode (3) requires the following additional tags setup in the DFN, in order to define a bounding box that restricts the NPC's movement:</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">fx1=-1</span> / <span class="highlight">fixedXCoordinate</span><br>
						Set to -1 to use the NPC's spawn location combined with a "radius" (fx2 if specified, otherwise defaults to 10) to determine the farthest number of tiles NPC is allowed to move in directions <strong>east</strong> and <strong>west</strong> from spawn point. Can also be given a positive value to set a fixed X1 coordinate for the bounding box.</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">fy1=-1</span> / <span class="highlight">fixedYCoordinate</span><br>
						Set to -1 to use the NPC's spawn location combined with a "radius" (fx2 if specified, otherwise defaults to 10) to determine the farthest number of tiles NPC is allowed to move in direction <strong>north</strong> and <strong>south</strong> from spawn point. Can also be given a positive value to set a fixed Y1 coordinate for the bounding box.</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">fx2=radius</span> / <span class="highlight">fixedXCoordinate</span><br>
						If fx1 and fy1 are set to -1, any positive value given for fx2 will act as a "radius" determining how far in each direction from the spawn point (east, west, north, south) NPC is allowed to move. If fx1 and fy1 have positive values (fixed coordinates), fx2 will be used to set a fixed X2 coordinate for the bounding box.</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">fy2=fixedYCoordinate</span><br>
						Only used when setting up bounding box with fixed coordinates, and is used to set the Y2 coordinate for said bounding box.</p>
					</div>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px"><span class="highlight">npcwander=4</span> (Circle)<br>
					Unlike their 'square' peers in wandermode 3, NPCs setup with wanderMode 4 have a more rounded taste, and embrace a lifestyle entirely without corners. They're all about circles! However, if provoked, they might leave their precious circle for a limited time, before returning should the situation calm down. This wanderMode requires some additional setup (see below).</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_npcwander_circle">
					<label for="spoiler_npcwander_circle">Additional Setup for Circle WanderMode <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>Usage of the "circle" wanderMode (4) requires the following additional tags setup in the DFN, in order to define a bounding circle that restricts the NPC's movement:<br>
						<p><span class="highlight">fx1=#</span><br>
						Determines the X coordinate for the center of the bounding circle that restricts the NPC's wandering. If set to -1, will instead get the X coordinate from the NPC's spawn point.</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">fy1=#</span><br>
						Determines the Y coordinate for the center of the bounding circle that restricts the NPC's wandering. If set to -1, will instead get the Y coordinate from the NPC's spawn point.</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">fz1=#</span><br>
						Determines the Z (height) coordinate for the center of the bounding circle that restricts the NPC's wandering. NPC's bounding circle is considered valid if NPC is within a Z of 5 from this defined value.</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">fx2=#</span><br>
						Radius (in tiles) of the bounding circle that restricts the NPC's wandering.</p>
					</div>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px"><span class="highlight">npcwander=5</span> (Frozen)<br>
					NPCs in wanderMode 5 are cool as cucumbers, so cool, in fact, that they remain frozen in place on the same spot, unable to move. Come hell or high water, they will remain steadfast and stick to their spot no matter what.</p>
					<h3>Altering WanderMode through JavaScript</h3>
					<p>In addition to DFNs and code, an NPC's wanderMode can also be adjusted in JavaScripts used with UOX3's JS Engine, either via JS Methods for characters like <span class="highlight">Wander( x1, y1, x2 (radius), y2 )</span> and <span class="highlight">Wander ( x1, y1, radius )</span>, or the <span class="highlight">wandertype</span> JS property for characters. See the <a href="https://www.uox3.org/jsdocs/index.html" target="_blank" title="UOX3 JS Engine Documentation">UOX3 JS Docs</a> for more details on syntax and some examples!</p>

					<h3>Races in UOX3</h3>
					<p>The race system in UOX3 is integrated with both player and NPC characters, and offers numerous options for customizing the behaviour and properties of each race, like taking double damage from silver weapons, dealing more damage with a particular weapon skill, or being allied to or the sworn enemy of another race.</p>
					<p>By default, UOX3 is setup to work with the default player races that can be selected in the UO client's character creation (depending on client version) - i.e. humans, elves and gargoyles - and will automatically assign players to the associated race in the race system, but there's nothing preventing a shard admin from creating multiple other player races, and to provide players with other means of selecting a race for their character.</p>
					<p>Some default races have also been setup for monsters, like Orcs, Ratmen, Undead and Daemons (and more), while animals are generally divided into some predefined Predator and Animal races (with a few other special cases for Birds, Arachnids, etc).</p>
					<h3>How does it work?</h3>
					<p>Each race in UOX3 is setup in its own <span class="highlight">[RACE #]</span> section of <strong>UOX3/dfndata/race/races.dfn</strong>, which contain the various properties, bonuses and penalties associated with the race.

					<p><span class="highlight">[RACE 0]<br>
					{<br>
					NAME=Human<br>
					STRCAP=100<br>
					DEXCAP=100<br>
					INTCAP=100<br>
					PLAYERRACE=0<br>
					BANEQUIPLIST=1<br>
					BANEQUIPLIST=2<br>
					}</span></p>
					<p>Race 0 is the "default" UOX3 player race, which is applied automatically to all newly created (human) player characters, as well as any NPCs that have no other race specified. Here it is setup with stat caps that define the max amount of strength, dexterity and intelligence a player can get, as well as some entries for banned equipment - stuff humans are not allowed to equip.</p>
					<p><span class="highlight">[RACE 1]<br>
					{<br>
					PARENTRACE=0<br>
					NAME=Elf<br>
					PLAYERRACE=0<br>
					BANEQUIPLIST=2<br>
					}</span></p>
					<p>The second default player race is "Elf", which applies automatically to all newly created elf player characters. Whether this race is used or not is dependent on whether the shard uses a client version that has elves as part of the character creation process. This race is setup with a PARENTRACE tag that points to race 0, meaning that in addition to any custom properties defined, it will also inherit the properties of the parent race. Note that any inherited properties can be overridden by redefining the same property for the child race, and the terms "parent race" and "child race" in this context only applies to the logic of inheriting properties, and has no other gameplay or player-facing relevance.</p>

					<p><span class="highlight">[RACE 2]<br>
					{ // Player<br>
					PARENTRACE=0<br>
					NAME=Gargoyle<br>
					PLAYERRACE=0<br>
					RACIALAID=3<br>
					ALLOWEQUIPLIST=0<br>
					ALLOWEQUIPLIST=2<br>
					}</span></p>
					<p>The third and last default player race is "Gargoyle", which applies automatically to all newly created gargoyle player characters. As with the elf race, this is dependent on the server supporting a client version that has this race included in the character creation process. This race has been setup with a RACIALAID tag, which points to the monster-version of the gargoyle race (see below). This means gargoyle players will see monster gargoyles as allies in the game, which will not automatically attack the players as they might players belonging to other races. Additionally, this race has some entries to whitelist certain equipment lists, allowing gargoyle players to equip any items from these lists.</p>

					<p><span class="highlight">[RACE 3]<br>
					{ // Monster<br>
					NAME=Gargoyle<br>
					PLAYERRACE=1<br>
					RACIALENEMY=1<br>
					RACIALAID=3<br>
					}</span></p>
					<p>The first and only monster race listed in this example, the monster-variant of the gargoyle race has been setup as an ally to the player-variant of the gargoyle race, and as an enemy of the elven race. When two races are set as enemies of one another, members of those races can freely attack each other without any negative consequences to things like the reputation system and criminal flagging, and killing an enemy would not result in a murder count. NPC members of a race will attack members of enemy races on sight.</p>
					</div>
					<p>NPCs - whether monsters, animals, shopkeepers or adventurers - can be assigned as members of a particular race using the <span class="highlight">RACE=#</span> DFN tag, which can be added to a given NPC's DFN section in its relevant file under <strong>UOX3/dfndata/npc/</strong>. For example, monster gargoyles (found in <strong>UOX3/dfndata/npc/gargoyles.dfn</strong>) are setup with a RACE=3 tag, with the value 3 referring to the race ID for the monster-variant of the gargoyle race. Similarly, any <strong>undead NPCs</strong> are setup with a <span class="highlight">RACE=11</span> tag, which matches up with the "undead" race in races.dfn - which has a race ID of 11.</p>
					<h3>Slayer Weapons/Double Damage to Undeads</h3>
					<p>Any weapon can be setup as a "slayer weapon" - i.e. a weapon that deals double damage against members of a particular race. Historically in UO, the first such weapons were weapons with a "silver" property, which dealt double damage to any undead NPCs. In UOX3, any weapon can be setup with this effect simply by adding a RACE=# tag to the weapon's item DFN section under UOX3/dfndata/items/, which will then cause said weapon to deal double damage to members of whichever race whose ID matches up with the value used in the weapon's RACE tag.</p>
					<h3>Racial Combat Mods</h3>
					<p>Racial combat mods are <span class="highlight">bonuses or penalties</span> applied to skills during <strong>skill checks</strong>, or during calculations of <strong>base damage</strong> dealt when attacking someone with a given weapon-skill in combat. These modifiers apply to characters who are members of a race that has been setup with skill tags such as <strong>[SKILLNAME]G=#</strong> (bonus) or <strong>[SKILLNAME]L=#</strong> (penalty) - where # points to one of the <strong>MOD#</strong> entries in this section.</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_race_combat_mods">
					<label for="spoiler_race_combat_mods">Racial Combat Mods <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></label>
					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>Example: A race setup with a <span class="highlight">SWORDSMANSHIPG=3</span> tag will have a <span class="highlight">20% bonus</span> applied to any Swordsmanship skill checks, and will also receive a <span class="highlight">20% bonus</span> to base damage during combat when wielding a sword, <em>before</em> any other damage modifiers are applied. If <span class="highlight">SWORDSMANSHIPL=3</span> was used instead, it would be a <span class="highlight">20% penalty</span> instead of a bonus.</p>
						<p>Example of default [COMBAT MODS] setup in <span class="highlight">dfndata/race/races.dfn</span>, along with a couple of examples how to make use of them:<br>

FENCINGL=1 // Uses MOD1, i.e. 5.0% penalty to fencing
}</code></pre>
					</div>
					<h3>Races and Equipment Restrictions</h3>
					<p>When setting up player races, it can be useful to have the option to restrict who can equip certain equipment - either because the equipment in question only works with certain character models (like Gargoyles), or to setup visual styles unique to each race. Either way, the race system supports this, via the ALLOWEQUIPLIST and BANEQUIPLIST tags, and associated [EQUIPLIST #] equipment lists.</p>
					<h4>Allowing or Banning Equipment Lists</h4>
					<p>The ALLOWEQUIPLIST and BANEQUIPLIST tags give shard admins the option to specify which equipment lists (see below) should be allowed or disallowed for each individual race in the race system. A given race can be setup with multiple of each tag, to allow or disallow multiple equipment lists.</p>
					<p>By default, the "human" player race has been setup with two banned equipment lists (BANEQUIP=1 and BANEQUIP=2). Those lists contain items only usable by Elves (for traditional reasons), and items only usable by Gargoyles (for technical reasons):</p>

						}</p>
					</div>
					<h4>Equipment Lists</h4>
					<p>Equipment lists for races can by default be found at the bottom of UOX3/dfndata/race/races.dfn, and a typical list will consist of a [EQUIPLIST #] header, and a series of ITEMS tags that list out all the item IDs that make up the equipment list.</p>
					<p>In the below example, each ITEMS tag contains a different "sub-category" of equipment, but this is just done to make it easier to find specific items in the list (in theory, all items in an equipmentlist could be setup in the same ITEMS tag). When UOX3 starts up, all the items in a given equipment-list are loaded into memory, and from there on referenced whenever a player attempts to equip a particular piece of equipment to see if the race they belong to allows it.</p>

					<p>The gain of skills and stats in UOX3 is governed by a system setup in <strong>UOX3/dfndata/skills/skills.dfn</strong>, where each skill has a setup similar to this:</p>

					<strong>[SKILL 0]</strong><br>
					<strong>{</strong><br>

					<p>SKILLPOINT Entries work in this way:
						<ul>
							<li>The <strong>first</strong> value is the skill level at which this entry takes effect.</li>
							<li>The <strong>second</strong> value is the chance to gain skill on success.</li>
							<li>The <strong>third</strong> value is the chance to gain skill on failure.</li>
							<li>The <strong>fourth</strong> (optional) value is the amount to gain on success.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Each additional SKILLPOINT entry sets a ceiling for the previous one. Thus entries should be created for every step you wish there to be, to gradually slow down skill gain. By default these steps are: 0-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400, 400-500, 500-600, 600-700, 700-800, 800-900, 900-990, 990-1000. Note that all skill values are *10, thus 100 instead of 10.0</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">

					<p>UOX3's <strong>Spawn Object</strong> system lets shard admins setup item or NPC spawns in-game using GM commands, or setup predefined spawn objects in the DFNs that GMs can then drop at any location where they want something to spawn. Examples of such predefined spawn objects can be found in the GM <span class="highlight">'add</span> menu, under <span class="highlight">GM Menu > Spawners</span>. If adding spawn objects via this menu, drag and drop the spawn object from your backpack to the ground to activate the spawn cycle. If you are unable to move it from your inventory, try using the <strong>'allmove on</strong> command first!</p>
					<p>Unlike objects spawned via <a href="#uox3SpawnRegions" title="UOX3 Documentation - Spawn Regions">Spawn Regions</a>, ones spawned from Spawn Objects have a persistent state and will be saved during world saves and are loaded again if server restarts.</p>
					<p>Four main types of spawn objects are available:</p>
					<h4>Item Spawner</h4>
					<p>Spawn Objects of item type 61 (<span class="highlight">IT_ITEMSPAWNER</span>) will spawn items at the spawn object's exact location.</p>
					<input type="checkbox" id="spoiler_spawnobject_item">

					<div class="spoiler">
						<p>Here's an example of an Item spawner that could be defined in a DFN file like <span class="highlight">dfndata/items/gmmenu/spawners.dfn</span>. Like other spawner objects, it inherits some properties from a base_spawner, to save on the need to redefine these common properties for each individual spawner (the base_spawner itself, meanwhile, inherits properties from a base_item object):</p>

The spawned object will be invisible and immovable to normal players, and will immediately start spawning bags of magical reagents. Note that Item Spawners, unlike NPC Spawners, do not support specifying an amount of items to spawn - these are restricted to 1 per Item Spawner, to avoid stacking multiple of same item on the same tile.</p>
					</div>
					<h4>NPC Spawner</h4>

The spawned object will be visible, but immovable to normal players, and will immediately start spawning items inside the container at a random interval between the min and max minutes specified in the interval tag.</p>
						<p>As soon as an item has spawned inside the Spawn Container, the item type of the spawn object will change from <strong>63 (IT_SPAWNCONT)</strong> to <strong>64 (IT_LOCKEDSPAWNCONT)</strong> and players will need to unlock it using lockpicks or the Magic Unlock spell before they can get to the treasure inside. Upon being unlocked, the type will reset back to <strong>63 (IT_SPAWNCONT)</strong>.</p>
						<p>If you don't want the Spawn Container to be locked, even after spawning/respawning items, change it's type to <strong>65 (IT_UNLOCKABLESPAWNCONT)</strong> instead. By doing this, the container will not automatically lock itself when a new item is spawned.</p>

					<h4>Spawn Regions</h4>
					<p>UOX3's regional spawning system allows the spawning of thousands of NPCs and items without affecting world saving or loading times negatively, as anything spawned through this system is not saved, and will not persist through a server restart, but will respawn on every server startup. This is useful for generic monster spawns, NPC shopkeepers and townsfolk, random item spawns like magic reagents, etc.</p>
					<p>The spawning system is setup through <strong>UOX3/dfndata/spawn/spawn.dfn</strong>, and an example of a setup for this can be seen below, or by examining the <a href="https://www.uox3.org/downloads.shtml" target="_blank" title="UOX3 Community-made spawn files">Community-made spawn.dfn</a> file.</p>

					<h4>Predefined Spawns</h4>
					<p>In addition to dedicated spawn regions, this system also supports setting up generic, <strong>predefined spawns</strong> that can be applied directly in regions in <strong>UOX3/dfndata/regions/regions.dfn</strong>. The benefit of such predefined spawns is that they can be re-used in different regions, and can piggy-back on the regions that already exist instead of having to create new dedicated spawn regions with coordinates etc.</p>

				  <div class="text-component">
					<p>UOX3 comes with a system for townstones that allows players to setup their own player-run governments in different regions of the world.</p>
					<p>The basics of the system is as follows:
						<ul>
							<li>Player gets hold of a Townstone Deed, and uses it while in a given region of the world to found a new Town.</li>
							<li>Using the Townstone Deed will place a Townstone on the ground, which the player can interact with to see details of the newly established Town</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>List of features in Townstones System:<br>
						<ul>
						<li>Townstones are based on regions</li>
						<li>Multiple Townstones may be placed in one region, but they all give
						 info about the same region.</li>
						<li>Townstones are of two types (automatically determined) based on the
						 information in regions.scp file.</li>
						<li>Players may become a resident of a town, wilderness, or none at all.</li>
						<li>Residents of a town may freely leave residency to none.</li>
						<li>If a player is a resident of another town then the one he/she wants to join, then they will automatically leave the prior town upon their joining the new town.</li>
						<li>Residents of a town (other then wilderness type) may vote for mayor.</li>
						<li>Residents of a town may vote however often they wish, but votes are not tallied until the 'election day'.</li>
						<li>Residents of a town may opt to display the town they are from on their paperdoll. If they choose to display their town title, their reputation title will not be shown (may be changed at a future date).</li>
						<li>The elected Mayor is forced to display their town title on their paperdoll. It is in the format of "Mayor <playername> of <townname>, <skilllevel> <skill>"</li>
						<li>The elected Mayor has "Mayor" prefixed to their displayname from allnames.</li>
						<li>If a mayor leaves residency of the town for either none, or another, then a new mayor is automatically detected based on number of votes at that time.</li>
						<li>Townstones display the current mayor on them.</li>
						<li>Townstones display the total population for that town.</li>
						<li>Wilderness regions display 'unruled region' for mayor.</li>
						<li>Wilderness regions display 'unknown' for population.</li>
						<li>To cast a vote for Mayor, the person whom the player wants to vote for must be online, and preferably onscreen. (Target based).</li>
						<li>If voting is 'mis-targeted' then the previous vote is unchanged.</li>
						<li>Residents may not vote for players who are not a resident of their same town.</li>
						<li>The player whom a person is currently voting for is displayed on the townstone.</li>

					<p>World templates are files read and written by the <span class="highlight">'decorate <em>save/load/clean/copy</em></span> commands (see <strong>'decorate</strong> command in <a href="#commandList" title="UOX3 Documentation - Command List">Command List</a> for full details on syntax), and essentially work as blueprints for world decoration, which can be easily loaded, re-saved after changes/additions or even be transferred between shards.</p>
					<p>These templates contain items such as <strong>doors</strong>, <strong>signs</strong>, <strong>lights</strong>, <strong>moongates</strong>, <strong>teleporters</strong>, <strong>containers</strong>, <strong>spawners</strong> and "<strong>misc</strong>" (any other item type), and each of these item types are saved to their own text file, per facet, with a .jsdata file extension. Examples:<br>
					<em>felucca_doors.jsdata<br>
					felucca_containers.jsdata<br>
					trammel_doors.jsdata<br>
					trammel_spawners.jsdata</em></p>
					<p>UOX3 already comes with a default set of such world template files stored in <strong>UOX3/js/jsdata/worldtemplates/</strong>, but they are optional to use, and new shard admins can choose between starting out with an empty world or to load the default templates - either select parts of them or in full.</p>
					<p>Through the 'decorate command, shard admins can save out templates to <strong>pre-defined files per facet and object-type</strong>, or to <strong>custom template files</strong> where all objects are saved to the same file. Example: <span class="highlight">'decorate save myCustomTemplate</span> would save <em>ALL</em> items on <em>ALL</em> facets to a custom template file called "<strong>myCustomTemplate.jsdata</strong>", which is then stored in <strong>UOX3/js/jsdata/worldtemplates</strong>. Note that the location of these files might differ for a given UOX3 configuration, depending on whether the SCRIPTDATADIRECTORY in uox.ini has been modified from the default.</p>

The DFNs can be safely modified and dynamically reloaded while UOX3 is running, as the only other time UOX3 reads from these files (and never writes) is on server startup. After making a change, simply use the <span class="highlight">'reloaddefs</span> command in-game, or console command '<span class="highlight">7</span>' after unlocking the UOX3 console by pressing '<span class="highlight">*</span>'.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
				  <div class="text-component">
					<p>Say you, as a shard admin, want to customize some of the DFNs that come with UOX3, but you worry about those changes being overwritten when time comes to update the default UOX3 package with a newer version, or about going through conflict/merge hell trying to weave all your custom changes into a newer version of the scripts.</p>
					<p>Enter, the <strong>DFN Priority System</strong>, the purpose of which is to allow DFNs to be loaded in a specific order, allowing shard admins to potentially override the default script packages by ensuring their custom DFNs get loaded last, aka get priority treatment.</p>
					<h3>How to Use the DFN Priority System</h3>
					<p>In the root folder of the type of DFNs you wish to override, create a new file using your favourite text-editor, and name it "priority.nfo". For instance, if you wish to override parts of carve.dfn with the contents of a custom file named customcarve.dfn, place the priority.nfo file in the DFNDATA\CARVE\ folder, right alongside the carve.dfn and customcarve.dfn files.</p>
					<p>The contents of customcarve.dfn would in this case be a copy & paste of one of the entries from carve.dfn, but with some minor changes applied - carving an alligator gives 24 meat instead of 12:</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px"><span class="highlight">// alligator</span>
					<span class="highlight">[CARVE 1]</span><br>
					<span class="highlight">{</span><br>
					<span class="highlight">ADDITEM=0x09f1</span><br>
					<span class="highlight">ADDITEM=0xc002,24</span><br>
					<span class="highlight">}</span></p>
					<p>Next, inside the priority.nfo file, copy paste the following default setup:</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px"><span class="highlight">[priority]</span><br>
					<span class="highlight">{</span><br>
					<span class="highlight">DEFAULTPRIORITY=0</span><br>
					<span class="highlight">customcarve.dfn=1</span><br>
					<span class="highlight">}</span></p>
					<p>The DEFAULTPRIORITY line determines the base priority level of all DFN files, which is normally left at zero. In this example, this would assign a default priority of 0 to carve.dfn, while next line would assign a priority of 1 to customcarve.dfn - ensuring that the contents of customcarve.dfn get priority over the default DFN file and is loaded last. Now, if there are any entries in these DFN files that conflict with each other, the copy in customcarve.dfn would take presedence, since it's loaded last!</p>
					<p>You can use this method to override any DFN file inside the DFNDATA folder.</p>

					<p>UOX3's scripting engine is based on an embedded C++ implementation of JavaScript called <strong>SpiderMonkey</strong> (<a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/release-notes/js_170" target="_blank" title="SpiderMonkey 1.7.0 Change Log">v1.7.0</a>). It allows UOX3 to load, read and interpret JavaScript files containing JS events, methods, functions, objects and properties written specifically for UOX3 in order to expose the inner workings of the server to prospective shard admins and script writers.</p>
					<p>UOX3's JavaScripts can be reloaded dynamically without restarting the server, making it very easy to iterate on new features or modify existing ones.</p>
					<p>Example of a simple JavaScript in UOX3, used with the Dice and Cup object to allow players to roll a dice and have the number displayed for others to see:<br>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function onUseChecked( pUser, iUsed )
{
	// Generate two random numbers from 1-6
	var iDice1 = RandomNumber( 1, 6 );
	var iDice2 = RandomNumber( 1, 6 );

	// Fetch the name of the player using the object
	var pName = pUser.name;

	// Display the result either as an emote above player (if object is in a container) or a message above item (if on ground)</em>
	if( iUsed.container != null )
		pUser.EmoteMessage( pName+" rolls the dice and gets a "+iDice1+" and a "+iDice2+"." );

							<p>To handle an incoming network packet in the JS engine, first ensure that <strong>OVERLOADPACKETS</strong> is enabled in <em>uox.ini</em>, and that the script has been assigned a unique scriptID in the <strong>[PACKET_SCRIPTS]</strong> section of <em>jse_fileassociations.scp</em>.</p>
							<p>Next, in the JS script handling the packet, register the packet in question with UOX3's packet handler, so it knows to direct any requests with this packet to the script in question:
<pre><span class="highlight">function PacketRegistration()
{</span>
	// Leave the second value (subCmd) at 0x0, as it's not implemented yet
	<span class="highlight">RegisterPacket( packetNum, 0x0 );

	<span class="highlight">...</span> <em>// Read packet data here, using ReadBytes, GetByte, GetWord, GetDWord, GetSByte, GetSWord, GetSDWord and GetString socket methods, and respond if needed, by creating a new packet object followed by WriteByte, WriteShort, WriteLong, Send and Free packet methods. See <a href="https://www.uox3.org/jsdocs/" target="_blank">UOX3 JavaScript Docs</a> for additional details and examples.</em>

	<span class="highlight">return;</span>

							<p>Then, in the same script, use the <strong>onPacketReceive JS Event</strong> to handle the incoming packet. Note that once a script has been registered as handler of a network packet, <strong><em>said script is entirely responsible</em></strong> for reading the bytes associated with the packet and forming any/all responses that the client might expect. Not sending a response, or sending the wrong response, or reading an incorrect amount of bytes from the socket buffer <strong>can result in unpredictable behaviour by the client and/or server!</strong></p>

					<h3>UOX3 History Crash Course</h3>
					<p>UOX was originally created by <strong>Denny Zuko</strong> aka <strong>Jaegermeister</strong> in 1997 for the pre-alpha version of Ultima Online, and was subsequently abandoned, rewritten from scratch by <strong>Marcus Rating</strong> aka <strong>Cironian</strong> and released in closed-source form as UOX2 the same year.</p>
					<p><strong>UOX3</strong> is, as the number in the name implies, the <em>third iteration</em> of UOX, and when released by Cironian in 1998 it become the first open-source UO server emulator. While he is no longer involved with the project, hundreds of other people have since contributed to updating and maintaining UOX3, and those efforts are still ongoing, with <a href="https://www.uox3.org" title="UOX3 Community Homepage">UOX3.org</a> now acting as a central hub for ongoing development and support.</p>
					<p>In 2001, UOX3 went through a monumental shift as the code base moved from C-style code to C++. Many systems (like accounts, items and characters, map regions) went through an overhaul that reduced complexity and increased performance. Memory consumption was improved, file IO was reduced, data structures were streamlined and shrunk, and network bandwith utilisation was improved.</p>
					<p>UOX3's scripting system was also upgraded - from the basic, trigger-based system used in the 0.68x and 0.70.x versions, to a fully fledged scripting engine based on Mozilla's SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine. These changes were spearheaded by Matthew Randall (EviLDeD, lead developer at the time) and Daniel Stratton (Abaddon), and prompted a change in version numbers, from 0.70.x to 0.95.x.</p>
					<p>Due to the open-source nature of UOX3, there have been numerous spin-off projects over the years - like Wolfpack, Lonewolf or NOX-wizard - all with their own rich history. Most of these have gone dormant, but the "main UOX3 branch" has been around for nearly 22 years (as of 2020), and is here for the long run.</p>

					<h3>How it Got Started</h3>
					<p>Emulation of the Ultima Online servers started all the way back in the days of the Alpha version of UO, when Denny Zuko (Jaegermeister) created the initial version of UOX (now lost to time). Since then, a great number of different emulators have come into existence, and although some of them were like fireflies that faded away after only a brief existence, others stuck around longer, spawned derivatives, forks and alternate versions along the way.</p>
					<p>For a more extensive and detailed overview, check out the <a href="https://www.uox3.org/history/timeline.shtml" target="_blank" title="General UO Emulator Timeline at UOX3.org">General UO Emulator Timeline over at UOX3.org</a>!</p>

					<p>The UOX3 Hall of Fame is simply a list of people (or their nicknames) known to have contributed to UOX3, in what capacity they (primarily) contributed, sorted in chronological order based on the estimated time of their first contribution.</p>
					<p>This list was written and is updated with the help of various UOX3 documents such as changelogs, news updates, code comments and some educated guesses, and errors might occur. If you spot a mistake, or a missing name, let us know and we'll do our best to correct the issue.</p>
