<center><h1>First official UOX3 House of Commons Chat</h1>
<h4>January 16th, 2000</h4>
</center>

<p><font color="#FFC840">첶uri: Soon now..<br>
첮ain-: The time has come...<br>
첮evana: hold on.. =)<br>
첶uri: *whistles*<br>
첔baddon: please have just a little patience, we are almost
there folks<br>
첪Bot: yes our apologies<br>
첔baddon: Sorry we took so long guys, but we will be starting
now</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: The aims of this forum is for users to ask questions
of us, and suggest potential future things... very similar to the
uohoc forum<br>
첔baddon: Now, Xuri will be the question taker, so if anyone
has any questions, private message him and he will pass it on to
us<br>
첔baddon: So, let the games begin.... Send those questions to
Xuri =)<br>
첮evana: and me..</font>
</p>

<p>
첶uri: &lt;Leper&gt; What is the status on the bug fixing for
UOX3? And what was the most difficult bug to fix?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: At the moment, we are all endeavouring to do our
best when it comes to bug fixing. It is a top priority that we
see right now<br>
첔baddon: Fur fixed what was probably the most difficult one,
the memory leak/crashes and the char/item loss<br>
첔baddon: at least, it would be the most difficult one for me
=)</font>
</p>

<p>
첚viLDeD: &lt;Zarnon&gt; Is there a time from for completion of this debugging phase?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첚viLDeD: We would like to have the last phase of debugging
over with in the net 2 weeks.<br>
첚viLDeD: We are trying to get a full fledge connection, and
server willing to host a very large, and constantly running
server to work out ALL the bugs possible, will be a public shard
as well, and everyone will be able to sign up. for the power
test.<br>
첚viLDeD: We cant give any promises as to exactly when but we
are doing out best.</font>
</p>

<p>
첮evana: &lt;Morticus&gt; Will there be any type of Quest
generators?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: It is not in our short term time frame at all<br>
첔baddon: We have noted it as a future potentiality, but we
make no promises on time frame<br>
첔baddon: It would be neat though</font>
</p>

<p>
첔baddon: &lt;Zarnon&gt; Are there any planes to add the
Select/Set course for boats with the world map?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: It is not actually considered a bug right at the
moment, it's just a feature that we haven't implemented as yet<br>
첔baddon: Our goal is to make boats fully functional and bug
free, as best as possible<br>
첔baddon: It involve some networking/packet type stuff, I'm
not sure if we actually have the details on it, but I'd probably
place it as medium term solution</font>
</p>

<p>
첚viLDeD: &lt;UnknownHost&gt; after the freeze is over, what's
next on the agenda?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첚viLDeD: I would like to say great things, but haven't we all
heard that one before. next on the agenda, we are going to
broaden the scope of Races, as well as do our best at developing
a more real life set of rules regarding Experience, notoriety,
alignment, Skill systems to give UOX3 a more real feel.<br>
첚viLDeD: There have been some really good things thought out
regarding town politics, and other systems that *cough* might
make it into the emulator ya never know. But you didn't hear that
from me</font>
</p>

<p>
첔baddon: &lt;darksentry&gt; Has the bug related to trading
(when the person on the receiving end right clicks, they
automatically take the item, regardless of other checks) been
addressed? And also, is it possible (or will it be possible) to
alter merchant selling prices on a global level? (making prices x
a value)<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: Well, that's a new bug that I haven't heard of, and
I guess it's something to investigate =)<br>
첔baddon: And as for altering prices on a global level.... we
haven't really gotten feedback as to really needing that at all,
but yes, it's something we can certainly look at, I don't imagine
it would necessarily be TOO difficult to implement...<br>
첔baddon: No promises on a time frame though</font>
</p>

<p>
첔baddon: &lt;Morticus&gt; What about triggers? Will there be
more incorporated to aid NPC's in order to make quests? (or is it
already possible)<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: Yes, we all have wonderful plans to flesh out the
trigger system.<br>
첔baddon: EvilDeD and Revana both have ideas for some
triggers, and I have a few triggers lying around that I can merge
in in the not too distant future, I imagine<br>
첔baddon: It all depends on how well the debugging goes in the
next 2 weeks<br>
첚viLDeD: Yea I have in here too. there have been lots of
ideas regarding this topic to, none of which have seemed to offer
the flexibility that we want, while at the same time giving nice
low lag play on lower ended machines.</font>
</p>

<p>
첚viLDeD: &lt;Ripper&gt; what is the eta on multithread in UOX<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첚viLDeD: Well Ripper *cough* isn't it past your bed time, or shouldn't you be up here with the rest of us...<br>
* Revana chuckles<br>
* Rain- grins<br>
첚viLDeD: To answer that. I am looking to get my hands on the
code right now, and add in the console threading system, and lay
in the foundation for the login thread as I have promised. The
time is near my friend.</font>
</p>

<p>
첔baddon: &lt;Ghosty&gt; What are you doing about the client
lock-ups that happen when there are many floor tiles /
decorations in one area?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: Well, we do what we can. But the biggest trouble
with that is bandwidth limitations<br>
첔baddon: You probably notice that the real UO doesn't
actually use that many floor tiles in one place<br>
첔baddon: The trouble is that each and every tile has to be
sent to each client, and the client ends up getting flooded with
information, and on slower modems, it just can't keep up<br>
첔baddon: One potential solution is to use WorldForge to merge
them in with the native map, it will certainly reduce the
bandwidth required<br>
첔baddon: but we do realize that not every shard has that
option, so we will try and see what we can do</font>
</p>

<p>
첚viLDeD: &lt;JustMichael&gt; When are flying creatures and
swimming creatures going to be added to UOX?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첚viLDeD: Abaddon has the snippet for flying creatures, so I
would most likely think that it will go in after the feature freeze
is over, or possibly when boats are worked out completely. Other
wise it will find it way in soon I would imagine, unless someone
else can offer any more info on this<br>
첔baddon: I have the snippets, but the only reason it wasn't
put in weeks ago was because I got around to it around midnight,
and I didn't think too clearly way back then =)</font>
</p>

<p>
첔baddon: &lt;Zarnon&gt; The region spawn is a fabulous
feature, but it will put npcs in invalid locations, like the
black area in dungeons, will/can this be fixed?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: Well, we always try and improve things where we can,
of course<br>
첔baddon: The biggest trouble with region spawners is the fact
it's not necessarily particularly easy to determine what is, or
is not, an invalid location<br>
첔baddon: The trouble will be finding a sufficiently quick
way of determining, because we certainly don't want to slow the
server down =)</font>
</p>

<p>
첚viLDeD: &lt;Someone&gt; Hmm... how about local price shifts,
depending on the stock that the shopkeeper already has (% against
restock value)? -- I'm not sure whether that's been discussed /
implemented... but as I can't actually think of another
question... :)<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첚viLDeD: Good question, even if it was outta lack of anything else to ask. Once the freeze is over as I sort of answer a
question earlier, there are going to be some more body blown into
some of the existing system, as well as some new systems added
that will provide the ability to offer complex commerce like you
described. It has been discusses, it has not been implemented,
and We will certainly take your interest in it as a positive vote
that its<br>
첔baddon: just a note to the people who have turned up, send
any questions you might have to xuri or revana</font>
</p>

<p>
첮evana: &lt;Badmoon&gt; Are there any plans to implement
mini-games such as chess to be useable by players (if it has not
already been implemented)?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첮evana: Well, currently, there are no plans for game boards
since it is the feature freeze, but yes, I think it would be a
great implementation. I can have a look after the feature freeze
and see what I could do, but no promises.</font>
</p>

<p>
첔baddon: &lt;darksentry&gt; Has the functionality of the
remove button been added to bulletin boards or will it be added
any time soon? Also, have there been any plans to get books
working properly? (users can't open or read/write in books)<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: As for books, I have the snippets lying around for
that, so it shouldn't be too difficult to implement. Once again,
feature freeze is priority, and that's why it hasn't been done
yet. But they are fully useable books<br>
첔baddon: As for the bulletin board, it hasn't been touched in
god knows how long. One thing we need to do is take an inventory
of what is in, what isn't, and what would be nice. But it is
something we can look at, though I have no idea how soon</font>
</p>

<p>
첔baddon: &lt;Rain-&gt; Here's a question.. - What would you
say is the best GM tool to use at the moment?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: That's a tough one, for sure<br>
첔baddon: I personally use my memory, and knowledge of the
command list, though I know most people won't =)<br>
첔baddon: CGMT is old, and has a lot of reduced functionality
because of it<br>
첔baddon: ShardAce is the most complete, and a lot of people use it<br>
첔baddon: xGM hasn't been updated, though it is still alive<br>
첔baddon: and TGMT is an upcoming tool, I believe, hough it is
still too early to say</font>
</p>

<p>
첮evana: 첡ustMichael: Will the account system be fixed
before the feature freeze is over? Specifically how it currently
messes up accounts after the one you delete.<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첮evana: Yes, fixing account is the second top priority for
me. (The first is my mid term exams). Some things you can expect
is a new format, but it will also work with the old one, and the
new acct system will never mess up with characters.<br>
첚viLDeD: On that one JM, We think that the account stuff
should be fixed, as that is not a feature but a bug. I am not
informed on the corruption, but if you want to detail it for me I would be happy to have a look into it.<br>
첮evana: also, minor note<br>
첮evana: If you do experience acct problems, please send it to
revana@uoxdev.com, that way, I can compile all the problems<br>
첮evana: so I can fix everything.</font>
</p>

<p>
첔baddon: &lt;^Treker^&gt; Will it be possible to ride Dragons
and other creatures in the future?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: It would certainly be nice, wouldn't it? =)<br>
첔baddon: Yes, it would be a nice feature for us to try, and
that is one thing that we will be looking at in the future. It's
something I wanted to work on earlier, but never got around to
(mostly due to races).<br>
첔baddon: But I have no idea how soon that might be</font>
</p>

<p>
첔baddon: &lt;Someone&gt; A lot of the messages on the board
are about the &quot;nameless&quot; items that are being produced
by players... It seems that the &quot;NAME&quot; field of the
items are blank. - as opposed to &quot;#&quot; - Any plans to
fix?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: In actual fact, I sent JM our current source only 30
minutes ago, and he said he would look at that for me. So in
theory, it's a short (very) term solution<br>
첔baddon: Possibly today, maybe tomorrow. Certainly within the
week</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFC840">
첶uri: Any more questions, people? /msg me then.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFC840">
첚viLDeD: I have to make a comment in this lull of questions.<br>
첚viLDeD: There was a decision made by me last night that may
effect a lot of people, but I think for the better. The current
script team was fired!! I don't even know who all that meant, I
know that effects Sephiroth, Rain, and a few others, but I made
this choice based on the fact that the scripts were and are
getting really messed up.<br>
첮ain-: Doesn't affect me..<br>
첚viLDeD: At this time Eagle is the head of the scripting
team, and I think is the best choice right now. Rain, or anyone
that thinks they should be on the team still please talk to Eagle.
Lets work together to make this great EMU and script.. no hard
feelings just a decisions to better the project on a whole<br>
* Rain- reminds Evil he wasn't on the team</font>
</p>

<p>
첮evana: &lt;Someone&gt; How about the secure trade bug - that
sets your weight to about 400 until you try to move? -- Stamina
goes bye-bye and you're stuck until you move an item in your
backpack?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첮evana: I believe that is a new bug.. but I guess the team
will have a look into it.<br>
첮evana: but.<br>
첮evana: more information would be better.<br>
첚viLDeD: Yea, on all bug reports, at all time please be as
specific and forth coming with where you were, what you were
doing carrying, etc. when submitting bugs. This helps us track
them faster</font>
</p>

<p>
첚viLDeD: 첕oris: Will adding own pictures and sounds ever
be implemented? possibly after freeze devs try to make a UOX
client?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첚viLDeD: When things come together with the devs this year we
will start our journey into designing a uoxdev client to be used
with the UO EMU's out there. Not sure how long it will take, but proves to be a very exciting venture to undertake. I would
like to
start dropping features, and gold, but I am going to have to just
say be patient, and see what the future hold..<br>
첚viLDeD: As for the Secure trade bug I am not up to speed on
that specifically at this time, maybe one of the other devs might
be able to pop in here. Otherwise it has been noted and will be
looked into</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: About the secure trade bug when right clicking, I
just received a fix for it and it is in the source<br>
* Xuri cheers<br>
첔baddon: thank Dupois for that one on the board =)<br>
* Rain- thanks him</font>
</p>

<p>
첮evana: will necro REALLY work?<br>
첮evana: that's from Boris<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첮evana: There is two groups working on necromancy currently..<br>
첚agle: also let me make a small note here is you have any bug
that are 100000000% sure that its a script bug e-mail it to me
and i will be sure to get it fixed... ( eagle@uoxdev.com )<br>
* Revana glares at Eagle<br>
첮evana: I dunno which one will go in, both are different in
how they work. But I guess it will be the public's opinion<br>
첚agle: =) i am working on the new scripted spells....other
than that i believe rev is working on the hard code<br>
첚agle: for ( necro )<br>
첮evana: =)</font>
</p>

<p>
첶uri: &lt;Boris&gt; if there was a woodchuck in uox... how
much wood would that woodchuck if it could chuck wood?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첶uri: a woodchuck would chuck no amount of wood cause a
woodchuck can't chuck wood. Even if a woodchuck COULD chuck wood,
and even if a woodchuck WOULD chuck wood, SHOULD a woodchuck
chuck wood?<br>
* Revana laughs<br>
첮ain-: they don't chuck wood i hear ;)<br>
첚viLDeD: I was just going to say that the amount of wood that
the wood chuck could chuck wood was purely indicative as to how
large his tail was, and the size of his keyboard. so in short if
uox3 could chuck would it would start a fire :)<br>
첮evana: I really wouldn't care, just pull your sword and bash
the wood chucker.</font>
</p>

<p>
첚agle: &lt;Someone&gt; Scripters! Any plans for a
&quot;Scripting for Dummies&quot; FAQ anytime soon? I'm bumbling
my way through them, but I'd love a FAQ... :)<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첚agle: yea along with the new scripts there should be ALOT
more doc's and better written doc's<br>
첚agle: but that might not be until v35 scripts<br>
* Revana thinks Xuri should change his Xuri World Guide into
&quot;UOX For Dummies&quot;</font>
</p>

<p>
첔baddon: &lt;darksentry&gt; Is there any particular place
that discovered bugs should be posted? Or just sort of stick to
q/a on the stratics board?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: With keystone being down, it's a problem<br>
첔baddon: Xuri has been compiling a list recently and I will
go bak to displaying it on an HTML page for general viewing<br>
첔baddon: I'll also open up my email address soon which will
receive form based stuff from that page<br>
첶uri: So send me those bugs =) <a href="mailto:xuri@sensewave.com"> xuri@sensewave.com</a></font>
</p>

<p>
첔baddon: &lt;Badmoon&gt; The source for the new build is
being released tonight right?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: Any changes we make to source always go straight
into the CVS which is a publicly viewable area<br>
첔baddon: we also keep devupdate.txt up to date every time we
commit, so people know what happened<br>
첔baddon: Xuri is working on an update.txt so people know what
happened from the 69 series to the 70 series<br>
첚agle: FYI : if you want to look at the cvs goto
http://www.uoxdev.com/fur/<br>
쳎unt: A note to Linux Users out there. The compiler with
RedHat 6.X will not compile UOX source properly. Update to gcc
2.95.2 (the shipping version).</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFC840">
* EviLDeD THANK YOU!!!! It looks like the very first Meeting of
the UOX3 House of Commons has been an overwhelming success! Thank
you for taking the time to join, and participate if you have.
Only through this kind of exchange of information can we ever
hope to take UOX3 into the millennium. Thanks again from all the
DevTeam<br>
