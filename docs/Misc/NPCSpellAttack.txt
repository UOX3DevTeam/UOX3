NPC SPAttack Bits for UOX3
Compiled by Zane (giwo)

The spattack= setting in npc.dfn's matches the circle you want an NPC to be 
able to cast up to (IE a setting of 8 means he can cast any spell from 
Circle 1 all the way to circle 8 ).
Notably, NPC's can currently only cast certain spells, and theese will be 
chosen at random when he is able to cast.

Following is a list of spells an NPC can cast:

Circle 1: 	Clumsy, Feeble Mind, Heal (Self), Magic Arrow, Reactive Armor 
(self ), Cure (Self if poisoned), Weaken
Circle 2: 	Harm
Circle 3: 	Fireball, Poison
Circle 4: 	Curse, Greater Healing (Self), Lightning, Mana Drain
Circle 5: 	Blade Spirits, Magic Reflection (Self), Mind Blast, Paralyze
Circle 6: 	Dispel (if fighting a summoned creature), Energy Bolt, Explosion, 
Mass Curse
Circle 7: 	Chain Lightning, FlameStrike, Mana Vampire, Meteor Swarm
Circle 8: 	Earthquake, Energy Vortex

This should be massively updated allowing users to choose which spells 
specifically they want an NPC should cast, and allowing NPC's access to any 
and all spells.
