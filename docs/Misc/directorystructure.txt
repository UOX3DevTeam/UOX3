Purposes of each directory
==========================
accounts       -       Contains all the information about user-accounts
backups        -       Unchanged from previous versions.  Archiving goes in here
books          -       This contains all the books in the world
dfndata        -       This is the parent dir where the definition files will ultimately reside.  Currently, it is SCP based (and existing scripts should work).
                       Each subdirectory replaces an existing script.  The misc subdirectory is where you place your misc.scp, the npc directory is where you
                       place your npc.scp.  Note that trigger is likely to be deprecated (currently old triggers.scp do nothing).
dictionaries   -       For multi-language support
docs           -       Documentation =)
help           -       Mostly unused at the moment.  Help files and other things will go here in future.  However, the commands subdirectory IS useful at the 
                       moment.  If you place a file in there with the name of ACCT.txt, for instance, if you use 'howto and select ACCT, the contents of that
                       file will be displayed along with other information.
html           -       Default output directory for html output.
js             -       JScripts of all sorts are stored here, along with teleport.scp, js_fileassociations.scp and js_objectassociations.scp
logs           -       Logs of all sorts will be here.  That includes server logs, packet logs, and error logs (though not all currently do).
msgboards      -       Data for ingame msgboards are stored here.
shared         -       World file location.  Note that there is a distributed world file system now, breaking the world down into smaller geometries.
                       A world converter IS being worked upon that will convert from this format to an old one, and vice versa.
