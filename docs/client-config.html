	<div class="SectionHeader">Supported Client Versions</div>
		<p class="Section">Generally speaking, the latest publicly available version of the UO client is always preferable when connecting to a UOX3 shard. </p>
		<p class="Section">In those cases where updates to the client are destructive for normal gameplay on your UOX3 shard, either because of changed client functionality or because it simply doesn't like UOX3, warnings will be posted in the forums not to run the UO patcher until those issues have been fixed.</p>
		<p class="Section">Making a backup of your client.exe before any patching progress is, in any case, highly advisable. </p>
		<div class="SectionHeader">Encryption Info</div>
		<p class="Section">Since UOX3 does not accept incoming connections from encrypted UO clients, you must find a way of removing the encryption from the client before you can login. To do that, you can use one of the many tools that exist for just this purpose. </p>
		<p class="Section"><a href="http://www.connectuo.com" title="ConnectUO Homepage">ConnectUO</a> is one such program, and is the one recommended for use with UO clients connecting to UOX3 shards. It removes the encryption at run-time only, and does not alter your default UO client permanently in any way.</p>
		<p class="Section">Download it. </p>
	<div class="SectionHeader">Configuring ConnectUO </div>
		<p class="Section">After downloading and installing ConnectUO, start it up. You will be greeted by a download bar - worry not, that is just ConnectUO retrieving the latest updates and/or list of privately run UO shards. </p>
		<p class="Section">Once the download is finished and ConnectUO is started, click on the link named &quot;<strong>Add Local Server</strong>&quot;. Enter a name for your shard (visible to yourself only, so doesn't matter what you write), as well as a description if you feel like it - before moving on to the important part.</p>
		<p class="Section">Under &quot;<em>Host Address</em>&quot; you must enter the IP-address to your UOX3 shard. If your UO client is situated on the same computer as your UOX3 shard, enter <em>127.0.0.1</em> as the IP. If the UOX3 shard is on a different computer, for instance on your LAN or even on the Internet, enter the LAN/Internet-IP for the shard instead. In all cases, set the &quot;<em>Port</em>&quot; address to <em>2593,</em> unless you have specifically changed that in UOX.INI.</p>
		<p class="Section">Also make sure the &quot;<em>Patch client encryption</em>&quot; checkbox is enabled. When done making all the changes, click the &quot;<strong>Add</strong>&quot;-button to add your shard to your ConnectUO list of favourite shards. </p>
	    <div class="SectionHeader">Logging into your Shard </div>
		<p class="Section">On the &quot;<strong>My Favorites</strong>&quot;-list in ConnectUO, you should now see your shard listed. To launch the UO client, simply doubleclick on the name/icon of your shard in said list, and ConnectUO will automatically remove the encryption from the client as well as configure it for logging onto your specified shard.</p>
		<p class="Section">When the UO client has loaded, type in the username and password which you specified during the <a href="installation.html">Installation/Configuration</a>-process for UOX3, and you should be good to go!</p>
