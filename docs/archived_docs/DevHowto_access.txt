Each member can be assigned a descriptive "role" and can be:

Project Admins (bold):
Can access all project administration pages and has technicians rights.
Im not sure if Technicians can too, but I think only Admins can access 
the webdir and upload/delete at the anonymous ftp.

Technicians:
Can make file releases, can write access the CVS and can be assigned tasks.

Forum Moderator

Documentation Editor (which is Admin for docs)

Admin and/or Technician for each Tracker:

Technicians can be assigned tasks (I think they can change those then).
