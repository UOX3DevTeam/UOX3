<p>So yo'uve added a couple of world triggers and you've made sure you added all the hex ids preceded by an x that you want that trigger to apply to. Now you go and open this very short file, with a heap of hex ids and some words. So whats it do? Well, any item with its hex id is envoked with any world triggers bound to it when double clicked. I'm assuming that the words are just to describe what the ids are for, I changed a couple of them and it didn't make a difference. If you wish to add new sections, just place them at the bottom. You must also precede all hex ids in this file with a single x. That's about it, not much to this one at all.
