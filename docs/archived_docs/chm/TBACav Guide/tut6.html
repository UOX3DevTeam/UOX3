<p>The second in the series on each of the script files, I intend to show you the ins and outs of the create.scp. This script deals with all of the makemenus in the game (those menus that pop up when you use a skill like blacksmithy or carpentry). I'll start by giving a template for a makemenu, then explaining how all the parts of the game link together, and then ill show you how to write your own as well as giving insight  into how you might go about creating new manufacturing skills (an example is the painting skill script on Jerelith's page).

<p>So what makes up a makemenu? Here's a template I prepared earlier:
<table>
<tr><td>// Blacksmithing<td>The name of this section
<tr><td>SECTION MAKEMENU 1<td>// the makemenu number. note that like items and npcs this number cant be used by other makemenus
<tr><td>{<td>// this opens the menu
<tr><td>Blacksmithing<td>// The name of this particular makemenu, you can pretty much name it anything
<tr><td>1416 Armor<td>// this is the start of one entry in this menu. the number (1416) is the hex id of the static art tile to use as an icon, and the word/s is what is displayed in the bar at the bottom of the makemenu (in this case the word armour is displayed)
<tr><td>RESOURCE 10<td>// this states that it requires 10 of the resource needed for this skill (ingots in this case) for this icon to display
<tr><td>SKILL 178<td>// this states that it requires 17.8 of the required skill for this icon to display
<tr><td>MAKEMENU 3<td>// this is a link to another menu, not an item that can be created, so it goes to the makemenu stated here (in this case it goes to makemenu 3, which is the makemenu for armour)
<tr><td>1B73 Buckler - 10 ingots<td>// the name and picture. Because this is a item that can be made, I choose to display the amount of the resource required as a courtesy to my users
<tr><td>RESOURCE 10<td>// same as for a menu link, you need 10 ingots for this icon to show up
<tr><td>SKILL 10<td>// the amount of skill required for this to turn up
<tr><td>ADDITEM 192<td>// this states the item that will be made if you are succesful (the item number is the itemsection number in items.scp)
<tr><td>RANK 1 10<td>// this has to do with the quality system. just use RANK 1 10 on all the things that can be made and you should be right
<tr><td>}<td>// this closes the menu
</table>
<p>So there's a fairly basic makemenu. In this case it is a blacksmithy menu and it contains 2 icons, 1 is a menu link and the other is a craftable item. Now I'm going to explain how everything links. If your eyes start to glaze over don't worry, I made a picture to help explain this.

<p>The image is at http://users.bigpond.com/bretonnia/scripts/create.gif

<p>Ok, so we start with a pile of resources (in this case ingots) and a smithing hammer. I beleive this one is set in the sourcecode and can't be modified without hard coding. In the trigger for when the hammer is invoked it wants you to select the resource. If you select iron ingots it is then coded to open up makemenu 1 (you can also use world triggers to do this, but i think it works better with coding and that is the only way that you can have multiple resources, ei coloured ingots).
<p>So now you sit there with the makemenu and you have a look in it. There's a heap of icons, each one is a seperate section in the blacksmithing makemenu. You select the one for armour and the script for that icon tells the game to open up makemenu 3. You then select plate and it opens up the next menu. Finally you select leggings. The game reads the script, finds its an item creation section, closes the menu and does the math on whether or not the item is made. Still with me? Good. Now that I've explained that it will be easier to understand how
to make new forms of crafting items.
<p>Because I'm far too lazy to make my own script for a new way of manufacturing, I'll just use the painting one i ripped from Jerelith. This script uses the inscripting skill to have a painting creation skill (or what you can best have atm). He has a heap of items including a paint and brush plus an easel:
<pre>
SECTION ITEM 700022
{
NAME paints and brush
ID xfc1
DECAY
VALUE 35
RESTOCK 10
GOOD -1
ALIGNMENT 0
MODIFY1 0
MODIFY2 0
MODIFY3 0
MODIFY4 0
MODIFY5 0
FAME 0
}

SECTION ITEM 700036
{
NAME easel and canvas
ID xf66
DECAY
VALUE 60
RESTOCK 10
GOOD -1
ALIGNMENT 0
MODIFY1 0
MODIFY2 0
MODIFY3 0
MODIFY4 0
MODIFY5 0
FAME 0
}
</pre>
<p>These are his making device (paint and brush) and his resource (easel). What then happens is you have a world trigger (wtrigger.scp):
<pre>
SECTION xf66
{ paints and brush
REQ xfc1
NEED xf66
MAKE 2000 23 xf 66
}
</pre>
<p>This is the trigger for the paint and brush. It says that xfc1 is a requirement (REQ xfc1). That's the art tile for the paintbrush. Note that if I had another item using that art tile that it would also be invoked. For this reason I believe it is better to use a item trigger (the item trigger would only apply to items that had a line linking to the trigger in their items.scp section). It also needs xf66 (the canvas). The MAKE command has 3 values after it, 2000 (this states goto makemenu 2000), 23 (this is the skill that is used, skill 23 is inscription), and a hex id (xf66, this states that the easel and canvas are the resource used for this skill). Note that it is not in the items item.scp entry (there isn't a trigger XXX line). This is because its a world trigger and they work differently (I'll explain those in another triggers tutorial). What it has instead is a envoke entry (envoke.scp):

<p>xfc1 paints and brush

<p>When the paint and brush is envoked (dbl clicked), then it checks if the user has an easel and canvas. If they have one or more it opens up makemenu 2000. And so a new manufacturing skill type thing is made.

<p>If all of this went over the top of your head, feel free to email me at tba_cavalier@bigpond.com. I will post up a full tutorial explaining every method on creating new types of creation skills sometime soon.
