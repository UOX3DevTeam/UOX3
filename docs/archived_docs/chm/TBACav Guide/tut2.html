<p>So you've made some new items, balanced them, and now you want to add
them to the shops and maybe let your players make them. I'll show you
how to let your players create items in a minute or two, but to start
off I'll give you all a couple of ways to add your items to the shops:

<p>There's 2 ways I know of adding items to shops. For this tutorial I have
my server running with some of my items (available in the scripts
section). I have also logged in as a gm and am using shard ace. I will
also add the in-game commands for the sake of completeness. I'm using
wordpad to edit any scripts.
<p>The first and easiest way to add stuff to your shops is to add or edit
an existing npc to sell your stuff. If you wish to add your items to
an existing npc, all you have to do is find their entry in the npc.scp
and find all the lines saying RSHOPITEM blah and SELLITEM blah. Say
I want the bowyer to sell my shortbow, I find his entry in the npc.scp
and add the lines RSHOPITEM 30015 and SELLITEM 30015. Here's what the
npc section would look like after I added those lines in:
<pre>

<p>That's the first way of adding items to your dealers. The other way is
in-game. First place the dealer and then open his sell pack using
shardace or 'gmopen 1a. Then create the item you want him to sell and
place it in his pack. The vendor will then sell that item. To allow
the vendor to also buy those items open his buy pack using shardace or
use 'gmopen 1c. Create and place the item in this container.

<p>Players can now buy and sell your custom items, but what if they want
to make them? For this the create.scp is used. Everything that you can
make as a player in the game is listed in this file. The sections are
split up into the various crafts, although submenus for different
things can go anywhere. Let's take a quick look around the create.scp.
Open it up with whatever you use (im using worpad). One of the first
things I can see is this:
<pre>
SECTION MAKEMENU 1
{
Blacksmithing
1416 Armor
RESOURCE 10
SKILL 178
MAKEMENU 3
1BC3 Shields
RESOURCE 8
SKILL 10
MAKEMENU 2
143E Weapons
RESOURCE 3
SKILL 113
MAKEMENU 4
09ed Misc.
RESOURCE 6
SKILL 250
MAKEMENU 105
}
</pre>
<p>Now what the hell does all that mean I here you ask? Well, its an entry
for the blacksmithy skill. This is the one that will come up when you
use tongs or a hammer on your ingots. The { and } brackets open and
close the entry, and here's what the rest means:
<table>
<tr><td>Blacksmithing<td>// This is the name of the menu.
<tr><td>1416 Armor<td>// This is the name of an icon. The icon uses an id which is the hex code in-front of the name.
<tr><td>RESOURCE 10<td>// This is how much of the resource the skill needs for this icon to show up in the menu.
<tr><td>SKILL 178<td>// This is the skill lvl that you need for this icon to show up. Tn this case it is 17.8 smithy skill.
<tr><td>MAKEMENU 3<td>// This is what happens when you select this icon. In this case it opens makemenu number 3. It could also add an item, in which case it would say something like ADDITEM 2938
</table>
<p>For the example I'll use my shortbow again, and I will add it to the
bowcraft section. Here is my current bowcraft entry in the create.scp:
<pre>
SECTION MAKEMENU 65
{
Bowcraft
1BD6 Shafts
RESOURCE 2
SKILL 100
MAKEMENU 66
13B2 Bow - 2 logs
RESOURCE 2
SKILL 300
ADDITEM 116
RANK 1 10
0F4F Crossbow - 2 logs
RESOURCE 2
SKILL 300
ADDITEM 117
RANK 1 10
13FD Heavy Crossbow - 3 logs
RESOURCE 3
SKILL 400
ADDITEM 118
RANK 1 10
}
</pre>
What <p>I want to do is add a section for the shortbow. To do this I just
add the following stuff (please note I have my item rank system on) in
front of the bow entry:
<pre>
13B2 Shortbow - 2 logs
RESOURCE 2
SKILL 250
ADDITEM 30015
RANK 1 10
</pre>
<p>Now if you did that right, when you carve up some logs it should
display the shortbow if you have enough logs and skill. Just as a bit
of a courtesy I always include the resource it takes to make a item.
To add in your own items, replace the id (13B2) with your own, rename
the shortbow to your item name, and set the resource, skill, and
additem lines to the appropriate settings for your item.
