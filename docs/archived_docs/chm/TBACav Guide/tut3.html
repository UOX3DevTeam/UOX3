<p>This is just a quick little lesson about creating your own npcs and
adding various settings to them. 3 examples are provided. We will start
with a blank npc in-game and fiddle with various settings. At the
moment this is the only one included, but on the weekend I'll add a
npc shopkeeper along with using the name and item lists and a monster
that also uses the loot lists. Here's a in-game demo of npc creation
then:

<p>Start up your server and login, I also have shardace running for the
convenience it offers. For this example you can make almost anything
you like, but we will be starting with a blank human npc. Use
'ADDNPC 01 90 in-game to add a male npc, or 'ADDNPC 01 91 to add a
female one. You should end up with a blank npc with the name dummy and
white skin (colour 00 00 I think). Change the skin hue to whatever
value you want by using 'tweak on the npc. A menu will popup and there
should be a thing that says skin. Click the manual button next to it
and change it to a suitable colour (remember to use the hex values, no
seperating space). Now you need to give your npc a name. For this
example I will call my npc Cav. You can do this by using 'rename Cav
on your blank npc. Now we need to dress him. This is why I like
shardace so much, it gives you a graphical representation of what items
there are, all neatly placed into subject thingys. Otherwise just use
the 'add menu to add some clothes and equipment to your npc. To get the
clothes onto your npc you will need to place them on the ground and
then drag them onto the npcs paperdoll. I will now share with you a
couple of the suits I like to wear:

<h3>The Jedi Master</h3>
<p>Use any sort of sword you want, just dye it a fluro colour (like a
light-sabre). Use a brown robe and a bandana of your choice. Not sure
that footwear matters too much so I don't wear it.

<h3>The Pirate Fool</h3>
<p>This one is sure to make you look like a fool. Just get a cutlass, a
red skullcap, a surcoat (white), a fancy shirt (also white), some
long pants (a greyish - black colour), and some black boots.

<h3>The GM Fool</h3>
<p>Another one that is sure to make you the laughing stock of any server.
Get a purple gm robe, a fluro green jester hat, and some sort of povo
weapon.

<p>Enough of that, back to the task at hand. What you now wish to do with
your npc is totally up to you. We can set some various npc ai's which
make it do different things. Here's a quick list of what they do:
<table>
<tr><th>AI<th>Command
<tr><td>a healer<td>'SETNPCAI 1
<tr><td>a monster<td>'SETNPCAI 2
<tr><td>a guard<td>'SETNPCAI 4
<tr><td>a banker<td>'SETNPCAI 8
</table>
<p>If your npc is none of the above, then you don't need to add any AI.
You will probably want to let the bloke walk around, so there's a few
things you can do with that. As far as I know, there are 4 working
npc wander modes. These are stay, wander, follow and circle. There is
a fifth one for rectangles but I'm not sure whether it works or not.
For this one I'm too lazy to write out the commands, so I'll just get
you all to use the npc section in shardace until I update this tutorial.
About the only other thing of note is turning the npc into a
shopkeeper. For instructions on doing this in-game see tutorial 2.
