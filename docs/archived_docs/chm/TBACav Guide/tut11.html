<p>The current uox scripts don't appear to have any traps in them, so if you can't find any to download here's how to make your own. First you start with an item, you need to give it the same name and I'd as the tiles around it if it's a floor trap, otherwise use whatever you want. Here's my cave floor trap (the item part):
<pre>
SECTION ITEM 30043
{
NAME cave floor
ID 053B
NODECAY 
TRIGGER 30043
TRIGTYPE 1
ALIGNMENT 0
MODIFY1 0
MODIFY2 0
MODIFY3 0
MODIFY4 0
MODIFY5 0
FAME 0
}
</pre>
<p>It has a trigger that when activated carries out the trap actions. But note there's also a new command in there, trigtype 1. What this does is it tells uox that when a player walks over this item the trigger should be activated, not when it is double-clicked. If you want the trap to be on a switch or something then just leave this line out and it will set it to the default which is double-click to activate. Now that weve got the item, you need to decide on the effects of the trap. In the cave floors case it fires an arrow at the player (you can't see it though) and the player takes 10 damage. Here's the trigger:
<pre>
SECTION TRG 30043
{ walk over stone trap
EMT Arghhh!
SND 02 24
ACT 14
HEA -10
DISABLE 5
}
</pre>
<p>Nothing really special. You emote Arghh! and the sound of an arrow being fired and hitting something plays. Your character then performs act 14 and 10 is taken off your health. The trap is then disabled for 5 seconds. Now that's a basic trap. Here's a more advanced one I prepared earlier:
<pre>
SECTION TRG 30044
{ walk over mushroom
EMT *cough* *cough*
SND 00 5e
ACT 14
HEA -10
SETID 11 26
SETTRG 30045
}
SECTION TRG 30045
{ walk over mushroom
SETID 11 25
SETTRG 30044
}
</pre>
<p>There are 2 things that change in this trap, the id and the trigger. Ids are changed by the setid command and the trigger in this trap is changed by the settrg command. I did this so the the mushroom goes back to its original state. What happens in this one is when the trap goes off it does the same as the last one pretty much except the id changes to the mushroom flinging dust stuff everywhere. When the player walks over it again the id changes back to the original one. There's one last command that I think would be useful in trap making, and once again heres a script I prepared earlier:
<pre>
SECTION TRG 30046
{ flip the wrong switch
RANGE 2
MSG You shouldnt go around flipping peoples switches
SND 00 54
IDFX 19 ab
EMT Arghhh!
ACT 14
HEA -10
SETID 10 90
SETTRG 30047
DISABLE 2
}
SECTION TRG 30047
{ flip the wrong switch
RANGE 2
MSG You shouldnt go around flipping peoples switches
SND 00 54
IDFX 19 ab
EMT Arghhh!
ACT 14
HEA -10
SETID 10 8f
SETTRG 30046
DISABLE 2
}
</pre>
<p>The new command here is idfx. This sends an effect between the player and target. Unfortunately it only goes from the player to the item that was triggered at the moment, but this should be adressed in the new scripting system (we won't have to deal with useless triggers anymore!).

<p>And so concludes this little trap tutorial, have a look at the art in InsideUO and a bit of a play around and you might come up with some interesting traps of your own...
