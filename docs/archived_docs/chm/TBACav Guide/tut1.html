<p>Alright, here's my first tutorial. I'll tell you how to make a new wep
based on an old one, and do the same with some armour. I'll also
mention any extra things you may want to add. After that I'll explain
a little about the ids of things, and show you using inside uo how to
make items using ids that aren't used in-game.

<h4>Your first weapon</h4>
<p>So you want to make a weapon? Well, here's what to do. Open up your
items.scp. Get used to this file, you'll spend a lot of time in it.
For this example I'm using wordpad. Click view, then find. Type in
'broad sword' without the quotes. It should find an entry at item 111.
Copy and paste this whole entry (from section item to the }) at the
very bottom of your items.scp. Next give it a unique item number, for
this example ill use 50000. Here's what we have so far:
<pre>
SECTION ITEM 50000
{
NAME Broad Sword
ID 0F5E
LAYER 1
LODAMAGE 5
HIDAMAGE 29
HP 90
DEF 5
DECAY
VALUE 80
RESTOCK 10
STR 25
SPD 45
WEIGHT 600
GOOD 27
ALIGNMENT 0
MODIFY1 0
MODIFY2 0
MODIFY3 0
MODIFY4 0
MODIFY5 0
FAME 0
}
</pre>
<p>Now we will edit the weapon and give it a unique name. Where it says
NAME, change it from broad sword to A Mystical Sword. Then under that 
line, add another line that says NAME2 Cav's Sword. NAME2 is the real
name of the item which is shown only when it is identified using item id. The next thing to do is change the damage to a lvl that you want. For this I'll use:
<br>LODAMAGE 50
<br>HIDAMAGE 100
<p>This means that every time the weapon hits, it will do a base damage
between 50 and 100. Because this is a magical sword, I will want to 
increase its value, set it so it cant be bought, change the speed it 
swings at and whether it decays. Here's the current item:

<pre>
{
NAME A Mystical Sword
NAME2 Cav's Sword
ID 0F5E
LAYER 1
LODAMAGE 50
HIDAMAGE 100
HP 90
DEF 5
DECAY
VALUE 80
RESTOCK 10
STR 25
SPD 45
WEIGHT 600
GOOD 27
ALIGNMENT 0
MODIFY1 0
MODIFY2 0
MODIFY3 0
MODIFY4 0
MODIFY5 0
FAME 0
}
</pre>
<p>To set a items value (for any item) just change the VALUE line to
whatever number you want. For this example change it to 1000. The line
that says RESTOCK sets how much of this item a vendor will have if
he/she sells it. I want to set this to 0 so it can't be sold.
<p>To change the rate this sword swings at, I change the SPD entry. The
higher the number, the faster the weapon swings. I will change this
setting to 50. Here's what I now have:
<pre>
SECTION ITEM 50000
{
NAME A Mystical Sword
NAME2 Cav's Sword
ID 0F5E
LAYER 1
LODAMAGE 50
HIDAMAGE 100
HP 90
DEF 5
DECAY
VALUE 1000
RESTOCK 0
STR 25
SPD 50
WEIGHT 600
GOOD 27
ALIGNMENT 0
MODIFY1 0
MODIFY2 0
MODIFY3 0
MODIFY4 0
MODIFY5 0
FAME 0
}
</pre>
<p>If you have that then your going well. The last thing I wanted to do
to this sword was to make it not decay. All I have to do is change
the line that says DECAY to NODECAY. Here is the final item:
<pre>
SECTION ITEM 50000
{
NAME A Mystical Sword
NAME2 Cav's Sword
ID 0F5E
LAYER 1
LODAMAGE 50
HIDAMAGE 100
HP 90
DEF 5
DECAY
VALUE 1000
RESTOCK 0
STR 25
SPD 50
WEIGHT 600
GOOD 27
ALIGNMENT 0
MODIFY1 0
MODIFY2 0
MODIFY3 0
MODIFY4 0
MODIFY5 0
FAME 0
}
</pre>
<p>That's your first weapon, enjoy it and feel free to change the
different things I showed you. The next item is a piece of coloured
platemail. I will also mention adding to your stats using items.
Open up your items.scp and find the entry for Platemail Legs. Copy and
paste this to the bottom of your items.scp file. Change the number of
the item to 50001. To change the colour of an item, you need to use a
variable called COLOR. You need to use a hex number from uo to achieve
this, but leave out the space. I want to dye this armour gold, so I'll
use COLOR 096D. I will also change the name to Golden Plat Legs. 
Here's what the item now looks like:
<pre>
SECTION ITEM 50001
{
NAME golden platemail legs
ID 141A
COLOR 096D
LAYER 24
DEF 8
DEXADD -5
HP 60
DECAY
WEIGHT 700
GOOD 10
ALIGNMENT 0
MODIFY1 0
MODIFY2 0
MODIFY3 0
MODIFY4 0
MODIFY5 0
FAME 0
}
</pre>
If you had that, then you've just made your first hued item. Now we will
change some of the items values, and I'll show you how to modify stats.
I want to add to the defense of the armour, and to make it so that there
is no dexterity penalty. To change the defense of the legs, make the
number next to def higher, I'll put it up to 10. Now look at the line
that says DEXADD -5. This is taking 5 points of your dexterity because
it has a negative sign in front of the 5. Remove this line and there 
will be no penalty for wearing this armour. This will also work for 
str (STRADD) and int (INTADD). There's one last thing I want to show you
on this item, its hitpoints. Notice the line that says HP 60? change
that to HP 100 and the item will last a lot longer. Here's what the 
final item looks like:

<pre>
SECTION ITEM 50001
{
NAME golden platemail legs
ID 141A
COLOR 096D
LAYER 24
DEF 10
HP 100
DECAY
WEIGHT 700
GOOD 10
ALIGNMENT 0
MODIFY1 0
MODIFY2 0
MODIFY3 0
MODIFY4 0
MODIFY5 0
FAME 0
}
</pre>
<p>So now you've modified a weapon and some armour, what do you do next?
How about creating a new item from scratch? Here's some info about item
IDs to get you started:
Every item has an ID. This sets what it looks like. Say you want to add
in a longbow, which uses the same picture of a bow, except it faces the
other way? Using InsideUO you can do this. Open up the artwork section,
go to the static tiles, and browse through it until you find what you want.
Then you can use this in the ID section of an item, or in-game type the
ID in with a space in between. Here's an example of a longbow and a bow
to show you what I mean:
<pre>
SECTION ITEM 116
{
NAME Bow
ID 13B2
}

SECTION ITEM 50002
{
NAME Longbow
ID 13B1
}
</pre>
<p>ID 13B2 is a bow facing the normal way, ID 13B1 is a bow facing the
other way. In this way it is possible to create new(ish) items. On the
other hand, if I had used these IDs in-game with the following commands,
I would have got a normal bow, just each would use a different picture.
<br>'add 13 B2
<br>'add 13 B1
