<p>You've probably read about the basic triggers, played with some world triggers, and guessed or looked for some advanced triggers. I'm now going to explain to you some of the more advanced triggers and roughly outline how you can combine them to create new enviroments, skills and other things (I will write up a more comprehensive guide to combining triggers and explain the usage of some of the most complicated triggers once I start the advanced tutorial series). So I'll start by explaining triggers that do a lot of calculating and can change and create visual effects.
