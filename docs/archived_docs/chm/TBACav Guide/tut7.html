<p>Yes, there is another type of triggers on top of npc and dynamic, these are called world triggers. But why do we need a world trigger? Why not just use normal triggers? Well, sometimes its heaps easier to just have the one trigger and bind it to a heap of items with just one command. Say for example, you wished for your players to be able to drink from the fountains or pick apples off trees. Instead of doing it the way I do (using triggers and new items - just so I dont stuff up anyone else's
work and the scripts I've made are easier to do it with), you just put the trigger entry in your world trigger script file, and then add a single line to envoke.scp. Simple, no?

<p>So what's in the world triggers? As far as I know, exactly the same as any normal trigger. Only 2 problems with this, first problem is that you cannot make it so when a player walks over the item it triggers. Second is if you wish to have the script require something, you will need to have this in hex id with each new item id being preceded by a single x. Heres the first entry in my world trigger script, the fountain thing I was talking about:
<pre>
SECTION x173fx1738x1739x173bx1741x173dx173cx139e
{ Replenish from a fountain
EMT *Slurp*  Ahhhh... Tasty!
SND 00 50
ACT 22
STAM 10
}
</pre>
<p>The massive amount of hex id stuff at the top is the art tiles it will affect. I cant stress enough that you MUST HAVE THE HEX IDS LISTED HERE PRECEDED BY A SINGLE x OR IT WONT WORK! This is effectively the same thing as section number in the dynamic and npc triggers - it tells uox what trigger it is and used to link to it to the item or envoke.scp. In this case it binds the fountain tiles with water in them. What you can now do is go into the game, type 'use and click on any fountain tile in the game with water in it. Go ahead and try it. See how you can drink the water. Fun, no? But to make it easier (and to make it so your players can access it - depends on your command set up) to use, you need to envoke it. To find out how you make an item envokeable, have a look at the next tutorial.
