UOX stands for Ultima Offline eXperiment.<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a server 
emulator for OSI's Ultima Online Server, created by Marcus Rating.<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This server emulator enables you to create your own server and play on it either 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; locally, over modem, LAN or the internet at least 32 people 
at a time.<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no fee to set 
up an UOX server, and there is no fee to play on one.<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UOX 
is currently in it's Alpha stages, which means that it isn't near to the<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
finished version. It has lots of the features you find on OSI's servers(see 1.3),<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but not everything works perfectly...yet.<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though Marcus Rating is the creator of UOX, he has 
released the code for the<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; server emulator, and many programmers 
are now working together to enchance further<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the emulator. 
One thing that came with the release of code, is that no one can<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
modify the UOX code, without releasing the modified code to the public.</FONT></SMALL></TD></TR>
