This will be your first chance to use your newfound Game Master powers.<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The first thing you should know is that for there is a thing called "Command prefix" which is the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
key you use along with commands so the server recognizes them as such instead of normal speech.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By default this Command Prefix is set to the key ' , so that means that you will have<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to use the key ' before every command you use ingame.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Command Prefix is scriptable,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
you can choose which key to use as prefix yourself, just open server.scp in wordpad/another text editor<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
then locate COMMANDPREFIX ' and change ' to whatever key you want to use, for instance !.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note: You CANT use / as command prefix, as the UO client uses this key for sending messages to party members.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The absolute first thing you should do is type in 'ADD; it is your main tool.<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It lets you do things such as make NPC's, items, or anything 
else you will need.<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First lets make you a GM robe. Your 
add menu is open right? Now double click on<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the icon of 
the hood (when you hold the cursor over it the bottom part of the 'ADD<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
menu window says GM items\tools) it should open a new window check the <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Game Master Item's button. Now hit Continue. Now do the same for the box that 
says<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Characters and Robes and hit continue. We are almost 
done at this point.... Check the<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GM robe (undyed) option 
and hit continue. A targeting cursor should now appear.<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Wherever you click a tile that says GM Robe should appear. Now type in 'KILLHAIR<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and target yourself. This should get rid of any hair you have 
on ya. Now type<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'DYE 0x0001 Now click on the robe icon on 
the ground. This dyed the GM Robe True black<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if you do 
a 'DYE with no numbers after it it will bring up a color selector.. but <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Black is not on it ;) ) Place the GM Robe on your paper doll and there ya go.<BR> 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some other basic commands are 'TELE which is the same 
as casting the spell teleport,<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'GMOPEN will open anything's 
backpack (this means you can add\look at loot in a<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monster's 
backpack) Something else you might wanna do is the 'SET command. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
What you do is 'SET Skill --- where skill is the name of the skill you are changing<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and --- is a number. Now because UO uses decimal numbers 90 
does not equal 90% skill. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 900 is 90 % (in UO when you 
are dealing with percentages remember to add the last number)<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Think of it as 90.0. 'SET also works with stats. The stats use Str, Dex, and Int 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (not Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence) Now with Stats 
90 equals 90 (as it is not <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; percentage based). Confusing 
enough? Now if you want to make it fair when you fight <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
the monsters you made with 'ADD, you can do a 'NOINVUL on yourself to make yourself 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;mortal&quot; again (meaning you take damage) and 
'INVUL will let you make something <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invulnerable. A few 
last commands you may want to use is 'DUPE (dupes an item) and <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
'SETAMOUNT ### (where ### is the amount) which sets how much of something is in 
a pile. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make you able to walk 
through doors and other items as a GM you have to use 'MAKEGM<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
on yourself. Just adding a GM Robe won't do no good in this case :P</FONT></SMALL></TD></TR>
