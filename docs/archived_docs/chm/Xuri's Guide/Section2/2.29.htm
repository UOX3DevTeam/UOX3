an owner to an item/npc. <BR>Lets say you want a horse you can ride on, well when 
you create them they are wild, and you dont want to run around and tame them. 
<BR>Then use the 'SETOWNER command.<BR> Lets say you as a GM has an Serial Number 
of 00 00 00 01 (you can find out your Serial by using the 'CSTATS command on your 
self), and you want a horse of your own. Then type... 'SETOWNER 00 00 00 01 and 
target the horse</P><P>You can also use 'SETOWNER on items. I think setting 'SETOWNER 
on an item will only allow the owner to use the item. But it only restricts the 
USE of the item. Not picking it up etc.</P></TD></TR> </TABLE>
