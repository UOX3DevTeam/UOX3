	If USESPECIALBANK 1 is activated the new banking system is active.<br>
	There is a common bank and a regional bank.<br><br>
	
	common bank -> you get your command-bank-box it if you say "bank" near a banker (bank-npc)<br>
	regional bank -> you get your reginal-bank-box if you say a trigger-word you can specify<br>
	via server.scp entry SPECIALBANKTRIGGER triggerword<br>
	for example SPECIALBANKTRIGGER WARE. --> the triggerword for regional bank is ware<br>
	so if you want to get you regional bank box in that case you have to say ware near a banker<br><br>

	so whats the differnce between those two bank-types ?<br>
	common bank, like the old system ...<br>
	you get all items you've placed in the bank EVERYWHERE.<br>
	So if you place 2 items in the bank of britain you see those same 2 items<br>
	if you open your bank box in the bank of vesper.<br>
	This principle only applies to the common bank.<br>
	The regional bank does NOT have it.<br>
	Regional banks work ... regional<br>
	So if you put items in the bank of britain you only get those items if you open a regional<br>
	bank box in britain.<br>
	If you goto the bank of vesper you WILL NOT see that items. <br>
	You see only that ones you placed in the vesper-regional box.<br>
	If you didnt place anything in vesper-regional bank it will be empty.<br>
	though you placed 2 items in britain bank.<br>
	Common-bank -> not regional, all items you place in a comman bank box can be fetched at any other bank.<br><br>
