<TD WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="19"><SMALL><FONT FACE="Tahoma">&nbsp; To make a player 
house(small houses, two stories, towers etc) you can enter 'ADD and <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
click on the GM menu. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now click on HOUSE DEEDS, and scroll 
along to find the house you want to place. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember that 
the spot where you are going to place the house MUST be free of <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
trees, rocks, bushes etc or else these will stick up through the floor...<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok when you have found the type of house you want to place, 
double click on the <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deed with it's name and place it on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
the ground. Now double click it again and you <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should get 
a ghost-image of the house. Move this ghost-image around,<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
and when you want to set up the house, just click again. If everything works as 
it <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should you will either stand outside of the house or 
inside. If you are inside <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the house you will probably 
be stuck, so write 'TELE and click on the ground<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in front 
of the house. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't see any house when you've placed 
it, but only the deed, try using <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'HIDEHS. This will show 
the house and hide the house deed. Be careful though, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
this command is known to have caused many crashes...(Type 'SHOWHS to see the house<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; icons again.)<BR> <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make a house of 
your own desire, you must manually place each section of the <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
house. Each section is the size of one UO square. A great tool to find the sections 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you need with, is InsideUO. This is a great program. With 
this you can &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; browse <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through all of 
UO's graphics and sounds and animation, and add them on your server <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
by entering ('ADD XX XX) where XX XX is the hex-number you get when you doubleclick<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on an item within InsideUO. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go here 
to find InsideUO : <A
