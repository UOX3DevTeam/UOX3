This is an improved version of Chaos & Order gates.<br>
Now you aren't limited to only two gates in your world, but can have as many gates as you want!<br>
Here's how it works, pasted from the man who wrote the code ;)<br><br>

"Openable Gates - by WIG based on Order&Chaos Gates code<br><br>

Ok, i found Order&Chaos gates stuff really great, but i noticed something:<br>
With order&chaos gates, you can only have 2 gates in your world, for example<br>
double-clicking on a Order Gate Switch will open ALL Order Gates in your world.<br>
But what will happen if you want to use these gate stuff in your castles, etc.?<br>
So i copied Chaos&Order Gates code, and modified it, so now you give the same<br>
morey to both gate&switch, and switch works for only gates with its morey.<br><br>

The gates use item type 205, and "gate openers" use item type 206.<br><br>

Here's what you should do to set up a gate (copied and modified from Xuri's UOX3 Guide):<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
First you add the gates themselves, called the "portcullis", either in<br>
north/south direction('add 06 f6) or in east/west direction ('add06 f5).<br>
Then set the gates to type 205, and 'setmorez 1 on them.<br>
After that, give all parts of your gate the same unique number using 'setmorey #<br><br>

Now after doing that, you add a key, switch, lever or anything else you<br>
want to use as "gate opener", and set it to type 206. Then, set the "gate<br>
opener"s morey to the same number you used for gates.<br>
The gates should now raise and lower after you use the gate opener."<br>
