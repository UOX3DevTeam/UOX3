A vendor is a NPC who sells/buys things from players. To make a vendor, either 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add one from the NPC menu ('ADD), or follow these steps 
to make your own.<BR> <BR> 
<ol>
	<li>Create a basic npc<BR>&nbsp;
	<li>Type 'MAKESHOP and click on the NPC. This will give him vendor status <BR> and buy/sell packs.<br>&nbsp;
	<li>Type 'GMOPEN 0x1a and click on the NPC. This will open the vendor sell pack. <BR> In this sell pack you place all the items you wish the vendor to sell. 
	<BR><blockquote>For example: You want the vendor to sell loafs of bread, so you add a loaf of <BR>bread( 'ADD 0x103b ) and place it on the ground. Now set it's 
type to 14, so people <BR>can actually eat it('SETTYPE 14).<BR> Place the loaf of bread inside the vendor sell pack.</blockquote>

	<li> Now set how many loafs of bread you want the NPC to sell each time he restocks<BR> ('SETRESTOCK #, and click on loaf).<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

	<li> Ok now you must set the price that players must pay to get a loaf of bread. <BR> Type 'SETVALUE $$ (insert price here), and click on the 
loaf of bread.<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

	<li> Now set the restockrate of the vendor. This is the time it takes for the vendor <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to restock when someone has bought something. Type 'SETSHOPRESTOCKRATE # <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(insert time in minutes here) and click on the vendor.<BR>
</ol>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok now you have a vendor who will sell things to people 
if they say &quot;vendor buy&quot;.<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you also want to 
make a vendor who buy things from players, you say? No problem, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all you have to do, is open the vendor's BUY 
pack, with 'GMOPEN 0x1c. Place all items <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you want the npc 
to buy inside here, and set the price he<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will give for 
those items ('SETVALUE $$ on each item).<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
So the NPC vendor has three packs...the Sell pack('GMOPEN 0x1a) the buy pack <BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ('GMOPEN 0x1c) and another pack where all the items the players 
have sold to the vendor<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lies ('GMOPEN 0x1b)<BR> <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The only thing remaining now, is to put some clothing on your vendor so as he/she 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will not freeze hehe...Go to 2.6 - CUSTOM NPCs, and look 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under &quot;Putting Clothes On Yer NPC&quot;.</FONT></SMALL></TD></TR>
