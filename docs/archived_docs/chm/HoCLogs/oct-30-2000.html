(Antitheus, 1 votes)</a><li><a href="#88">How do you plan to compensate for OSI's super duper secret project, UO:3D?

(Laocourn, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">We have established a build / hoc structure. Builds and HoC chats alternate each week. This week is a HoC chat, next week it will be a build. Week after that, it's HoC again, then a build. This system will progress for a long long time I imagine</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="82">With the new script system, will we be able to make NPCs despawn after a certain amount of time or an event? (Laocourn, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">I imagine that will be distinctly possible, yes. We're providing you with a lot of hooks into the server, and allowing you to spawn things, delete things, adjust things, set up timers, and lots of other things as well. So it's distinctly possible that you will be able to do this, yes</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="83">Will you ever be implementing a young system for the emulator? similar or working as OSI's? (PoseidonXIX, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">Please people, read the previous HoC logs. They're available at www.uoxdev.com. This question specifically was answered last time. But to recap</font><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">No, it's not likely. We've had basically no requests for this functionality at all, and we don't know how appropriate it may be. PR shard players tend not to be complete novices, and skill/stat gain is generally much faster on these shards.</font><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">If there's a screaming desire for it, then we'll definitely have a look at a young system. But from my last request, absolutely no one emailed me requesting it.</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="84">In your next build will you fix the T2A walking bug? where you fall down cliffs and cant walk up? (PoseidonXIX, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">Well, I've scoured the boards today, and I haven't finished looking yet. There was a post about bugs in t2a, but there was almost no details at all, and not even sure if they were using 20c (You are using 20c, yes? :>)</font><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">If people can email me with distinct descriptions, locations, and circumstances, then it can be looked into. But "the t2a walking bug" is almost meaningless in trying to track it down.</font><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">My other thought is this: Last I checked, if you fell down a cliff, you couldn't walk back up it anyway (I mean, it is a cliff, and it's sheer :>)</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="85">When can we expect seeing the 'banaccount and 'addaccount commands to be functional? (PoseidonXIX, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">Well, one of the things that EviLDeD and myself have been working on is a much improved accounting system. The way it is currently implemented is poor, and it needs a complete work over, not a few patches, and that's being worked on by EviLDeD. It will likely come in with the new rearchitected version of UOX (same time as the Scripting engine)</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="86">Have you noticed PVP crashing issues?

(Antitheus, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">No one has reported these issues to us. I haven't seen any posts on the board at all either. If you can reproduce it consistently, record a set of steps and information required to test it, and email it to me, Xuri, or submit it via the bug board</font><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">We cannot fix bugs with little information. Verifying it on another setup would be a good thing to (making sure it's not script issues)</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="87">Is a change to townstones\factions in the works? (Antitheus, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">We are planning a number of changes to townstones, and regions, and a few other things. That has been worked on, but has been put on the backburner a touch, due to other things requiring a higher priority. But yes, there is a change in the works</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="88">How do you plan to compensate for OSI's super duper secret project, UO:3D? Talk of a completely new client and MULs, etc. In my eyes this could tear apart any and all emus dependent upon it's client and MULs. (Lump_The_No-Legged_Gamer, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">Well, the secret nature of it means it wouldn't be a simple thing to deal with. HOWEVER, I don't imagine it's particular insurmountable. I would be shocked if they redid both the client packet format and the mul files, because that would essentially mean redoing the client entirely. It may be what they're doing, but it would have a big effect on the server too.</font><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">It'll be dealt with, there will be support for it long term, I can pretty much guarantee it. There's a lot of people who have a lot of interest in UO being emulated in the future</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="89">What's the official uox3 dev team favorite fast food? =p (Antitheus, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">Can't say for others, but for me, it's probably McDonalds, though Pizza Hut, Hungry Jacks, KFC and Red Rooster all come a close second</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="90">Currently there is a rather annoying bug in UOX causing Shopkeepers to have miss-named items for sale, e.g. the icon of a Chain Tunic with the description of a Pitchfork, one of the causes for this is adding items to a vendors pack in-game, any chance for a fix in the near future? (Zane, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">Well, from what I've gathered from others, this actually isn't entirely UOX's fault :> It's actually an OSI client issue. This does happen sometimes on OSI servers, and it happens to other emus as well. I imagine there are ways for us to minimize this situation, and we will look into it. But it's not entirely our fault :></font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="91">When will the UO 3D stuff be out and what all have they talked about to go along with it?

I had a chance to work some more last night (been short of time recently). All known fixes from the last few builds have been integrated, and I embellished the script system some more with a few more implemented API calls</font><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">I'm guessing that I now have over 100 working API calls, and a few supported events. Adding event support elsewhere should be fairly simple.</font><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">I received Thyme's rewritten walking, it's incomplete and I haven't had a chance to look at it, but I should hopefully be able to take it from there (he has major RL commitments happening)</font><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">So things are progressing nice and well, just short of time.
