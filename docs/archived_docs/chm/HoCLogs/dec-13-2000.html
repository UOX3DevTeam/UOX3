I haven't had a chance to talk with EviLDeD about the delay yet, I only know he wishes to delay it.

EviLDeD was robbed last week, and computers were stolen. I have a semi-recent backup of what he was working on, but there was a distinct code loss that needs to be redone</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="129">What is UOX? :) (Menace-LoD, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">If you don't know that, what are you doing here? :>. UOX is a UO server emulator, allowing you to run your own shard in an offline environment, or an online environment with some friends</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="130">What is the word on the new system for containers? (Backstab, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">Not sure exactly what you mean. The implementation details of containers have changed, allowing many features that never were possible (or were possible, but not feasible due to the nature of it's current implementation)</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="131">When will there be AT LAST be an alliance-option for the guildwar menu?? (Byron, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">I actually thought there was an option in our guild implementation to have alliances. WIth a quick scan of the code, it looks like there isn't. Real pity that, actually. However, guilds haven't always been a high feature request (or at least I get no requests about it), so that's probably why it's slipped through for so long</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="132">Is there anything in the works for new/better Monster AI, like getting around a crate someone tosses down? (Backstab, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">This has been mentioned and answered in a number of previous HoC chats (www.uoxdev.com for more information)</font><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">However, in the future, the AI will change.

(_Venom_, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">Perhaps not initially (I have other things much higher on the priority list). However, the frame work will be there, so even if it doesn't make it into the primary build, you should still be able to achieve it with scripts and customized gumps</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="134">How is the script team doing and what are they doing currently?

(Jerelith, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">Isn't that possible now? Using an item list with multiple gold entries and using that item list for that container.

We nearly have the frame work in that we want, and when that's in place, bolting on features should be a much simpler task.</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="137">How does one become part of the uoxdev team?

Not all snippets will get in, for sure, but we do encourage those to learn to code that can.</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="138">Is the Big Build comming out so soon thet we code Tinkerers should hold off on new projects till we see the new build? (Backstab, 1 votes)</a><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">It really does depend. I'd advise no, because learning to code on this project, whether pre or post big build, is a good thing.

If you worry that you'll find code duplicated, or systems different, then it's highly likely. We've been spending a lot of time on cleaning things up and changing certain internals. You're likely to have fixed something we might already have fixed</font><tr><td width="5%" VALIGN=TOP><font color="#FFC840">Abaddon</font><td><font color="#FFC840">But I still think no, because coding is useful regardless.</font></table><p></p><table><td colspan=2><a name="139">What is your hopeful estimate on the release of "the big build"?

I have a to do list that I'm working through, and that's getting smaller each and every day. Certain things on those list are deemed critical, but aren't all that simple. So... it really does depend, I don't know.
