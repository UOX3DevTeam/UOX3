<p><font color="#800080"> Welcome to another UOX3HOC Chat<br>
 We know it has been a long time since the last, and we do apologize<br>
 Tonight's meeting is pretty open, there's no specific topic<br>
 If you have any questions, /msg the QuestionBot in the form /msg QuestionBot !qadd My question to add goes here<br>
 and please, don't spam the bot :<br>
 Okay folks, ask away!<br>
</font><font color="#FFC840">
<br>
</font>Sephiroth: Question 2: "Are any drastic script changes going to take place relatively soon? or even at all?"<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Sephiroth: I'll take this I suppose ;)<br>
Sephiroth: I'm currently in the process of overhauling the existing scripts into a new system, which is basically the same as the current but cleaner.<br>
</font>
<br>
Abaddon Who are the key players in the UOX Dev Community and what are they working on now?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Abaddon: Well, actually, that's a very good question<br>
Abaddon: Recently the UOX Development Community has taken a big step forward<br>
Abaddon: As of now, EviLDeD and I are the 2 server coders<br>
Abaddon: EviLDeD is also the head of the project as it stands<br>
Abaddon: Recently, we created some more teams within UOX3 itself<br>
Abaddon: Decius now heads up our newly formed Tool Development Team<br>
Decius: :)<br>
Abaddon: He has a team of 9, and they will be endeavouring to bring you new tools soon<br>
Abaddon: Seph is the head of our Definition Team and our Script Team (currently the same, soon to be split)<br>
Abaddon: however, as of the moment, we have no Documentation Team (though we're still looking for one)<br>
Abaddon: Decius, why don't you tell us who's in your team, and if anything's coming soon?<br>
Decius: ok. Well as Ab just said currently there are 9members<br>
Decius: They are not just Americans, which will mean we could theoretically code<br>
Decius: 24hrs a day to bring you guys tools<br>
Decius: As they encompass most of the world<br>
Decius: As for tools well we are open to suggestions there are 2 tools currently in dev<br>
Decius: One is a Serial compactor which is coming out soon, this tool renumbers the SERIAL values in items.wsc and chars.wsc<br>
Decius: because as we all know the number doesn't ever get reset when you delete stuff.<br>
Decius: The other is a little hush hush till i get my head around the idea.<br>
Decius: As for members not many made it here today.<br>
Decius: If your a member and your here speak out now, damn it :)<br>
Decius: All tools will be open source along with an OCX i wrote before heading the team<br>
* Sephiroth notes that since it's moderated that is impossible ;)<br>
Unseen: Hehe, I'm helping with any database related stuff with tools.<br>
Unseen: And whatever other skills I can muster up<br>
Decius: Aside from that I guess I'd better mention I'm not a complete vb newbie at least i hope not. I've programmed a few things for UOX now.<br>
Decius: Anyway Seph you want to take the floor?<br>
Sephiroth: I'm heading up the script\definition team, Unseen is gonna be helping a bit too =).<br>
Unseen: Absolutely<br>
Sephiroth: Also, some questions have come in concerning what I said earlier (at least
that's how I understand them) the Definitions are like current scripts, they handle item's and npc's mostly.<br>
Sephiroth: The new scripts I'm not real sure yet, still haven't gotten a lot of info on them, but they will be based on jscript and I believe allow for some of the things
hard coded now to be scripted.<br>
Sephiroth: A reminder, if you're referring to a previous question, please point that out ;). Also, I'm still looking for Definition writers, and scripters, Email me at shogberg@myndtrip.net for any applications\info.<br>
Sephiroth: I'm done unless Unseen has anything to say.<br>
Unseen: Nope<br>
Sephiroth: Also, the new definitions will be done script side here within the week, since EviL isn't here I'm not real sure how long til it's done
code side<br>
</font>
<br>
 Is housing going to be worked on soon, or are other priorities coming first?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Abaddon: That's a very good question, and in actuality, I do have an answer, shock horror
:&gt;<br>
Abaddon: Yes, housing is definitely being worked upon. We do have things that are considered more critical<br>
Abaddon: But housing is definitely being worked upon, when it's complete it'll be a much cleaner system from a code perspective, and from an end user's perspective too<br>
Abaddon: It is part of our revamp to the source code, which is progressing well, and hopefully we'll be able to make a big general release within the month<br>
Abaddon: But as it stands at the moment, there are still a number of issues being dealt with<br>
</font><font color="#800080"> I'd like to mention, just in case anyone thinks this, I am not the Chaos that made CGMT =)</font></p>

<p> Any chance of adding an option into GM tools to change the command prefix for those of us who use 2.0.0 and greater?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Decius: That is an immense possibility, but can only be possible with tools we created. Unless other developers see fit to release code to use to change there tools.<br>
Decius: A lot of the tools such as CGMT were released a long time ago<br>
Decius: and the dev's for those have not been heard from since and without there source it will be impossible to change.<br>
Decius: Although in the future the Devteam will i hope come up with a new GM tool to beat ShardAce, CGMT and Accomplice.<br>
Unseen: Most tools still being supported support selectable prefixes, the others....like Decius said, no source, no luck.</font></p>

<p>If I manipulate my scripts now will I regret it and have to redo them after you make your changes?
Are they that drastic I guess I mean?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Sephiroth: This depends what you are doing really.<br>
Sephiroth: If it's adding a few items, it's easy enough to convert those over to the new system without worrying about item numbers\difficulty learning, it's really quite similiar (and the item numbers are quite flexible).<br>
Sephiroth: Rewriting the damages of every weapon would be something you'd have to do over, although I'm basing all my damage and
armour values off stratics.<br>
Unseen: I always follow stratics for my work<br>
Decius: Also my script editor supports current and Seph's new format and has renumbering and publishing facilities to fix scripts to new format.<br>
Decius: Blatant self plug :)<br>
Sephiroth: =)</font></p>

<p> Will UOX be multi-threaded in the future?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Abaddon: Yes, it certainly will be<br>
Abaddon: If you can find previous UOX3HoC chats, you'll know that's a yes<br>
Abaddon: There are a number of issues with threading though, and they each need to be dealt with<br>
Abaddon: From what I understand, a few have tried threading without much success, but we believe we know how to deal with that<br>
Abaddon: So yes, it's certainly on the agenda, no doubts of that<br>
</font><font color="#800080">Xuri: Speaking about the previous chats...I'll update uoxdev.com with the previous ones soon. (and this one too, eventually ;)</font></p>

<p> What are the major differences between UO and UOX?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Chaos: Thats a little tricky, but I believe this question means OSI style of gameplay and UOX<br>
Chaos: With UOX, as a shard admin, you have the potential of making your own items, your own monsters, etc<br>
Chaos: Its really limitless with what you can do, but of course, you can always make the game OSI style.<br>
* Sephiroth adds in There are utilities out there that permit you to change the map if you so desire.<br>
Chaos: All the resources can be found at www.uoxdev.com, and you can always get customized scripts =)</font></p>

<p>Is any one going to document all the features in uox, there are tons of undocumented features, commands etc in the source<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Abaddon: Well, that's why we're looking for a Documentation Team<br>
Abaddon: Yes, we want to document a lot more, and I'm working alongside Evil to document the source a lot better as well<br>
Unseen: I'm hoping to organize a lot of the features and functions (not source)<br>
</font>
<br>
What about the notoriety/monster aggression? also, will the new system of scripting be
interchangeable with the current system? cut/paste form old to new, vice versa<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Sephiroth: I'll take part 2 here.<br>
Sephiroth: Most of the new Definition system is the same as the old style. Most of it is just a rewrite for cleanliness and bug killing. The only new part is SECTION ITEM # is replaced with [itemname], and a few new commands.<br>
Sephiroth: Decius' script editor will auto change the item numbering part for you.<br>
Abaddon: As for monster aggression, that's being worked on<br>
EviLDeD: Ill head the first part of that answer up<br>
EviLDeD: Notoriety will be changed a lot over the long term, as it stands now it is very one sided in many ways.<br>
EviLDeD: As for aggression I am not sure how to answer that question possibly re submit that question with a little more specifics&nbsp;<br>
</font>
<br>
 Could you give us some information on what new features are coming to UOX3 in the future?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Abaddon: Well, we plan a lot really<br>
Abaddon: I can't really go into a lot of specifics (why spoil the surprise? :) but I can tell you the general stuff we've been working on<br>
Abaddon: Magic has taken a fair degree of revision, it's a lot neater now, we think you're going to love it<br>
Abaddon: Weather's been fleshed out and updated, and we'll be adding support for the seasons (in our own special way)<br>
Abaddon: Townstones are likely to change, combat's going to be neat, and accounts... well, there's a nice surprise there, that one I'm not going to spoil
:&gt;<br>
</font>
<br>
  Will you open for more programmers on the main dev team anytime soon?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">EviLDeD: YES! However time is  of the essence here, we are working to set up a system that will help secure the best team possible.<br>
EviLDeD: There is going to be an application process, and of course a screening process, and not withstanding that all fixes, and enhancements that are&nbsp;<br>
EviLDeD: considered to be good for the long term of uox3 it will be considered.<br>
EviLDeD: so in short answer to that quest yes we will be taking in 3 more coders when the time permits.<br>
EviLDeD: I suggest all you super coders and idea makers start getting all your ducks in a
room, and quaking a song, cause soon we will be looking</font></p>

<p>I plan on making my own noto system that combines with monster aggression, is the coding going to prohibit this or will the scripts alone
allow this to occur? Sorry if that is awkward<br>
<font color="#FFC840">EviLDeD: The new coding will most likely prohibit ANY hard coded changes that you
might make. As for the script as we flesh out the system more we can better answer that, but at this
stage I would like to say yes this would be something that we are keeping in mind<br>
EviLDeD: and that will most likely be very configurable on the whole.<br>
</font>Xuri: Just a note to any newcomers...To ask a question, /msg QuestionBot !qadd Your-Question-goes-here</p>

<p> Any chance of making it so we could use the old uo noto system in uox, this could be turned on or off?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Abaddon: Well, you could go in and code it I guess<br>
Abaddon: If you are prepared to put the time and effort in to code it, then go ahead<br>
Abaddon: But we feel that is not good for the future of UOX3, so it is not likely to go into the main development strand<br>
Abaddon: However, with the Scripting system we're planning to put in<br>
Abaddon: It may be feasible via that mechanism</font></p>

<p> When and where will there be a new official page for UOX3?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">EviLDeD: As soon as it gets completed. The new home will be www.uox3.net, and will
deal with everything related directly with uox3. As the main systems of this website are finished it will be made live, I hope that this would have been last month, however life is as life does and is busy as always.<br>
EviLDeD: so keep your browser pointed to www.uox3.net and look for the new website soon.. sorry for the delay.<br>
</font>
<br>
   Are there any UO Client emulators?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">knoxos: okay I guess that's my part<br>
Chaos: hehe<br>
EviLDeD: Yes there are, and knoxos the creator of one might wish to talk a little
about the emulator<br>
EviLDeD: now its your part.<br>
knoxos: thanks, yes there is a new UO client emulator on work, it is the only GNU i know of and it is written in java<br>
knoxos: I hope one day it will come with it's own graphic files, so the emulator community will be free. So you don't have to have the offical client anymore to play UOX<br>
knoxos: Currently you can view the static world in graphic world, and logon to an UOX shard and walk around in text based mode.<br>
knoxos: There is still a lot do, but a lot has been done already tough...</font></p>

<p> Are any new trigger tokens/methods gonna be coming our way such as the ability to wear items that fire triggers?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Abaddon: Highly unlikely, truth to tell<br>
Abaddon: The trigger system as it stands is just not worth the time and effort to invest into it<br>
Abaddon: We're hoping to supplant the trigger system with a much more powerful and flexible scripting system<br>
Abaddon: Having said that, we're trying to at least tidy up the triggers (not adding more) for a new release, so that you're not abandoned during the transition period</font></p>

<p> Also to follow up previous question will wearable items be able to directly modify stats and skills such as a Necklace of Treasure Hunting that gives +20
cartography or similar, you know where I'm coming from?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Abaddon: This doesn't really affect the trigger system so much<br>
Abaddon: As it stands, all stats can be modified by a particular item, but not skills<br>
Abaddon: Depending on demand, we'll look at adding skill modification, though it is distinctly possible</font></p>

<p> I was told by several people that all noto/monster aggression changes could be done within scripts and not have to alter the code at all, is this true? could i make a daemon
aggressive to a blue and not a red? (example)<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Abaddon: Well, as it stands I don't believe that is possible<br>
Abaddon: There are a few standard template AI's in the code<br>
Abaddon: but we're hoping to extend the system greatly with the Script system, so you will have final and ultimate control in that regard</font></p>

<p>Are you guys privately funded or you doing all this for the pure joy of doing it while working a steady job (do you people ever sleep... hehe)? rock on either way,
I just don't see how you guys can script and code 24/7 and still afford internet connection,
hehe<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Decius: For me its love, anyone else?<br>
EviLDeD: well thanks for the thought. no we are not paid, and yes for what ever sickness that this might elude to we do this all for nothig but the feeling of having even just one message like this one to make it all worth while...<br>
* Sephiroth coughs -Now Accepting Donations<br>
Abaddon: For fun, for learning, and to alleviate boredom :<br>
Sephiroth: wanna help out the cause, donate EviL a low GB hard drive so he can run his shard<br>
Abaddon: It's nice to be part of something big<br>
Unseen: I enjoy doing it, though some members of my family don't :P<br>
Decius: They come to repossess my phone tomorrow<br>
Xuri: I'm doing it (doing what?) because I can't sleep, really.&nbsp;<br>
* Sephiroth secretly takes all the funds and stashes them away from the other
devs\scripters<br>
Sephiroth: oops......<br>
Decius: hehe<br>
EviLDeD: we're not angels wither so send all donations  for the devteams, payable EviLDeD, and I will see that the funds make it to the respected team.<br>
EviLDeD: or maybe I will just start up a TeamGetTogther fund, where we can all play
baseball and bbq shrimps, and get drunken<br>
* EviLDeD wonders if he said that out loud<br>
* Xuri heads off to put a lot of pay-banners up on his site<br>
Sephiroth: drunked!!!!!!</font></p>

<p> Can you implement a script token known as No-Drop, so you can add high items requiring the user to earn it, not to get a million and give to newbies<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Abaddon: It would be nice wouldn't it?<br>
Sephiroth: bwuahahahaha<br>
Abaddon: We'd prefer it to be a part of the script system, though I don't think there'd be all that much harm in putting it in<br>
Abaddon: It's a nice idea, and... hmm, I can think of some other applications, yes... Okay, it looks like it could be a goer</font></p>

<p>   Can Decius be both good looking and intelligent? by Dices<br>
<font color="#FFC840">Decius: Yes I can!<br>
Decius: Can I add Egotistical to the list :)<br>
EviLDeD: Well that is only relevant to how much liquor is consumed over a brief period of time, balanced over the
amount of visible like and bar smoke, with bad music on in the background, and is only augmented by the number of peanuts still in the
bowl as opposed the on the floor.<br>
Decius: you know it<br>
Sephiroth: the answer is c<br>
EviLDeD: :))<br>
Xuri: hehe..<br>
Decius: Isn't the answer 3.2134?<br>
Sephiroth: only on Wednesdays<br>
Decius: Seriously i love these guys!!!<br>
Decius: oooh and Cameron Diaz and Jeri Lynn Ryan</font></p>

<p>Is it just me or are you guys the greatest people ever and are the Sphere people really Nazis or are they just mean to people who ask questions about things that require thought to respond
about?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">EviLDeD: Not sure how to take this one, as I know Westy, and nix, very well and well I have no ill towards them or
sphere in any way however if they are anal then I cant really comment. We try to answer all that we can if we can, As the only true way to determine
what's needed or not needed etc is to hear from the people that use it.<br>
Decius: here here<br>
* Sephiroth apologizes, but he must duck out, someone drink a pre-hoc beer for me<br>
Sephiroth: thats post-hoc</font></p>

<p>Is any of UO's files copyright? If so, why haven't we all gotten sued yet? =P<br>
<font color="#FFC840">EviLDeD: Because we are small fries :) so don't act like a big potatoes and everyone  will be a-ok<br>
Decius: Also its because we don't charge that OSI/Origin whatever don't pick on us as much as they might like :)<br>
Decius: After all can they sue us for a percentage of nothing?<br>
Decius: Questions is what I do!<br>
Xuri: And UOX itself doesn't violate any copyrights...no UO files are used IN UOX3. ;)</font></p>

<p><font color="#800080">Abaddon: Well folks, seems there aren't any more questions for us tonight<br>
Abaddon: Thank you once again for making UOX3HOC a success<br>
Abaddon: it was really good to see you all here, with so many questions<br>
Abaddon: And thanks for helping us test Qbot 0.1, it had never been tested before
:<br>
Decius: I luv Dices!<br>
Abaddon: Thanks all for coming, and have a lovely day<br>
Abaddon: If you have any further queries, message us when we unmoderate<br>
Abaddon: And remember, Decius is your Tool Dev Lead, Evil's your Project Lead, and I'm just a busy body who has too much time on his hand</font></p>
