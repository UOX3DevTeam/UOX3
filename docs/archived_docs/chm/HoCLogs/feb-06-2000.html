<p><font color="#FFC840">첮evana: Greetings and thank you for attending tonight's Open House.<br>
첮evana: Tonight's chat is "General Discussion"., please try to keep questions along these lines.<br>
첮evana: Uox3Hoc_bot will be the moderator for this chat..<br>
첮evana: To submit a question, do /msg uox3hoc_bot !question question here<br>
첮evana: Xuri will be on standby<br>
첮evana: just in case the bot fails<br>
첮evana: Ok<br>
첮evana: The Bot is now on<br>
첮evana: Please remember that there are 10 slots only for questions</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3Hoc_Bot : Are there any plans to optimise the code of UOX? Possibly create a UOX4? Or plans to reduce memory consumption by removing unused read in data?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: I'll field this one<br>
첔baddon: Yes, there are always plans to optimise the code in UOX. It's a never ending battle for us, but I doubt there'll be anything along the lines of a UOX4<br>
첔baddon: I myself have been looking at the way to reduce spell book memory consumption, and a few other things as well<br>
첔baddon: EvilDeD and I are conducting an analysis on the code, noting weak areas, ways to
optimise things, what can be removed<br>
첔baddon: but yes, we're definitely hoping for a reduced memory footprint and general speedups<br>
첹ippy-: I also have been digging around in the code, there are a bunch of places we could trim memory down for characters and items....</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3Hoc_Bot : About scripts, will we minimize them into smaller files, for easier debugging and modifying?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: Well, certainly<br>
첔baddon: in actual fact, Eagle plans to rewrite most of them from scratch. That way we don't have any bloated scripts<br>
첔baddon: And we'll only have the essentials required<br>
첔baddon: I don't know how far along Seph's docs are, but with newer slim lined
scripts should also come some documents<br>
첹ippy-: There are a few that aren't really needed at all... We'll look at those with Eagle and see which we can take out.</font>
</p>
<p>
첔baddon: Question: As it stands now, accounts cannot be deleted without skewing the accounts. Are there any plans to fix this, either by numbering the accounts or by some other means?<br>
<font color="#800080">첡ustMichael: I would like to add the new version of LoginAce will delete them without skewing the accounts.<br>
</font><font color="#FFC840">
첮evana: Ok, I'll field this one<br>
첮evana: Yes, I do have fixes for the accounts<br>
첮evana: Most of it works, and there are few bugs I have to crush unless you want to be able to login once =)</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : What are the future plans for UOX?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첹ippy-: Well, that's a vague question... but right now we want to get very stable and reliable exe first,<br>
첹ippy-: Then we have lots of plans for fun new things.<br>
첹ippy-: EviL wants to get threading in, as well as a VERY advanced script system for quests, triggers and such.<br>
첹ippy-: But right now we want to have something we can be proud of before focus shifts back to features.<br>
</font><font color="#800080">
첱ox3hoc_bot:  *** Please Remember, to submit a question, you have to type: /msg Uox3hoc_bot !question Your question. ***</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : What's currently the biggest bug.. in your opinion?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: Well, I'd classify this as a bug. The big problems with memory allocation and usage<br>
첔baddon: We're using up way too much memory, more than you'd reasonably expect<br>
첔baddon: And I've noted the last 3 times I had to try and realloc memory it just crashed me<br>
</font><font color="#800080">
첹ippy-: (About 700 bytes per item, and 1500 per character)<br>
</font><font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: The spawn.scp bug that causes a crash is actually memory related I believe, as well<br>
첔baddon: That's one of the reasons that a few of us are undertaking a major analysis of the memory situation</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : Why does uo freeze when I try to put my password and name in?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첮evana: Well<br>
첮evana: one solution to that problem is<br>
첮evana: that you either have a bad client<br>
첮evana: or the uox version is wrong<br>
첶uri: ...or the ip is wrong. or the port. or 1000 other small things *winks*</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : Is there going to be any ready to play full worlds for those who want to play offline?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첹ippy-: Well, there already are several available... I don't think there are many COMPLETE worlds, since those who have them like them too much to give away.<br>
첮evolutionShadow: Plus they would be too big<br>
첹ippy-: There are a few people attempting to make large public worlds, and I'm sure you could find links to pages if ya look around a little<br>
첹ippy-: Revo, weren't you working on one?<br>
첮evolutionShadow: RevNet's world file yes<br>
첮evolutionShadow: Will go public when the server finally goes down</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : What is the current goal if any on when the exe will be stable to add more features? And can we get the addmenu into its own file? :)<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첹ippy-: I'm not sure if we have an exact time frame... I know we would like it as much as the users would.<br>
첹ippy-: And addmenu has already been coded to go into its own file, we'll talk to eagle and evil about when exactly that will be
implimented.</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : When will the features freeze be over and we can get the rest of the spells working?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: Well, the feature freeze will be over when it's over<br>
첔baddon: We had hoped to have it over by now, but these things just can't be guarenteed<br>
첔baddon: There's no point us making definite time frame promises, because we just don't know exactly what may crop up<br>
첔baddon: Yes, we'd love it to be over and done with, to be able to add new features<br>
첔baddon: All of us would. But what's the point of adding new features when people are having such probs?<br>
첔baddon: As for the spells situation, if you consider it a bug, then message a coder with the exact details, and we can try and get it fixed<br>

</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : Why does UOX disconnect the UO Client when charting a boat course on a World Map?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: Well, I believe that this was asked, and answered, in the previous chat<br>
첔baddon: It's considered a lack of feature, not a bug<br>
첔baddon: It's essentially at the moment a packet we pass over, but we actually ignore it for the moment<br>
첔baddon: The only way to safely ignore it is to disconnect the client, otherwise you start running into probs with the other clients and mixed up messages</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : There appears to be a bug that causes a player not to be able to relogin into a shard (until it is restarted) if he tries to login when the server is initializing and then cancels before the server is done loading. Is this bug known? If so, any eta on it being fixed?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첔baddon: Well, yes and no, to a bug<br>
첔baddon: It happens because we init the port at the start of the code, and it's really an impatient user problem<br>
첔baddon: We could try moving the port initialisation further down, to try and mask these problems, but that may introduce others<br>
첔baddon: Another option is to block any receipt of messages before it finishes loading<br>
첔baddon: Another thing that needs looking at =)</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : I have several walking bug errors. For example, in Delucia normal players (non-GMs) fall through the floors. Is there any estimate to when walking issues will be resolved nearly 100%?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첹ippy-: The problem with this is actually the tile bits are set wrong in the mul files....<br>
</font><font color="#800080">
첔baddon: I must run, but the others will answer all your questions, please continue...<br>
</font><font color="#FFC840">
첹ippy-: Some solution is of course to make your own.... You could try patching these "holes" with dynamic tiles....<br>
첹ippy-: And of course walking is very complex....</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : So, any info on the possibility of a Macintosh client?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첮evana: Well, i can't guarantee a Macintosh client<br>
첮evana: but, currently, there are two clients in design. One is done by TUS, it's kinda like the regular client, just designed for their Emu. And the other one is a 3d client, it's in its basic steps, but hopefully, it will work out..</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : With the implementation of the newbie.scp a while back why is the initial starting gold still included within the uox3.ini?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첹ippy-: Pretty much, it was never moved... There a few things laying around we don't use anymore... perhaps it should be moved ;-)<br>
첖estle: I would think that would be done with Eagle's re-write that was mentioned
earlier</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : In the future will the books be dealt with differently? As it stands now books are created in the misc.scp. While this method makes sense, it does not allow players to create books on their adventures.<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첮evana: Yes, books will be dealt differently.<br>
첮evana: Currently, I have a source code for writeable books.<br>
첮evana: But since the feature freeze is in effect, I can't add it to the main source. So you'll have to wait and see.</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : About that 3D Client, do you know if it supports GeForce's T&amp;L Technology?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첮evana: yep. it supports it.</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : This 3D client interests me greatly. Who is currently developing it and how far along is it?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첮evana: Currently, it's a small organization.. the project is ran by
EvilDeD.. and I'm currently designing the engine..<br>
첮evana: It's still in it's initial stages<br>
</font>
첮evolutionShadow: Any URL?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첮evana: but if you wish to help, email me at revana@home.net<br>
첮evana: no URL, sorry =)<br>
</font><font color="#800080">

<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : Spawns at the moment tend to not care about where they spawn things. A region spawn will create a NPC within walls, under the floor tiles, in water, etc.. Is there any plans to fix this?<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첹ippy-: This has to do with the rewrite of a lot of UOX's map functions. They don't spawn on anything just a lot of stuff they shouldn't.<br>
첹ippy-: And this should be fixed soon, but I'm not a man of dates and times.... :o)</font>
</p>
<p>
* Uox3hoc_bot : When a house (multi) is created, it seems that the other people around the multi are not updated with the information that the house has been placed. They can see the door and the sign but until they walk away from the update area and back into it, they cannot see the building itself.<br>
<font color="#FFC840">
첹ippy-: Sounds pretty simple to fix... Famous last words: "I'll look into it" :o)</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#800080">
첮evana: Well folks, time to wrap up for the night. I would like to thank everyone for coming tonight<br>
첮evana: Please visit http://www.uoxdev.com/uox3hoc/ for the log which will be posted soon.<br>
