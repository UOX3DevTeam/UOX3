<p><font color="#800080">Welcome to yet another UOX3 House of Commons meeting. This weeks topic is <b>A users view into what is wrong, or right with UOX3. A talk about what things UOX3 could
be</b><br>
 Questions tonight will be handled by the QuestionBot again. Any questions you want, message the bot in the format of /msg QuestionBot !addq Your question goes here</font></p>

<p><a name="Q1">When will the next update release? (Kazuki|Shard, 1 votes)<br>
</a><font color="#FFC840">
Abaddon: Well, I imagine we could release a version tomorrow or the day after<br>
Abaddon: We have a few minor fixes (tailoring and the murder bug) which we will put in, and make a release of<br>
Abaddon: We might be able to make a few other fixes as well, depending on time frame</font></p>

<p><a name="Q2">Where's Seph!? (LeeKwan, 1 votes)</a><br>
<font color="#FFC840">
EviLDeD: If we told you , we would have to kill you.</font></p>

<p><a name="Q3">Will there be more Holiday Items like Tree Deeds. (JohnnyRingo, 1 votes)</a><br>
<font color="#FFC840">
Abaddon: Both EviLDeD and myself would like to see more of these particular items for players<br>
Abaddon: We don't know when it might happen, we have rather full plates as it is<br>
Abaddon: But yes, it would be a nice touch I think<br>
EviLDeD: Let just see what the fat elf brings this year.. ho-ho-ho</font></p>

<p><a name="Q4">When is UOX going to do the 1.0 release? (TailSpin, 1 votes)</a><br>
<font color="#FFC840">
EviLDeD: This has been a popular question. I think that we have a game plan that would have uox3 1.0 release comming out on Dec 31, 2000. Might even be at midnight.. Who know, however we are striving to make this date.<br>
Zippy-: Oo spooky.<br>
EviLDeD: the real millenium<br>
EviLDeD: ;)<br>
Xuri: Real is what you want it to be..*mutters*</font></p>

<p><a name="Q5">What major changes can we expect to see in UOX in the near future... and with that, when will UOX start pumping out the releases like they used too? (TailSpin, 1 votes)</a><br>
<font color="#FFC840">
Abaddon: Well, as we made mention to in the previous chat, we certainly have a lot of things on our agenda<br>
Abaddon: Scripting is the obvious one, it'll be much more powerful and flexible than it is now<br>
Abaddon: Accounts have been worked upon, but we won't spoil that surprise<br>
Abaddon: You'll be happy, most of our systems have gotten a major touch up. There's some nice magic stuff in the wind, as well as changes to many other things, like races, and weather, and all that wonderful goodness :><br>
Abaddon: As for pumping out releases.... well, we're aiming for quality, not quantity<br>
Abaddon: Yes, we aim to get back to regular frequent releases, but we want to make sure they are GOOD releases<br>
EviLDeD: The schedule that I was hoping to conform to would be an update bi-weekly<br>
EviLDeD: however this is a very time permitting thing.</font></p>

<p><a name="Q6">Who are the current developers on the dev team? (TailSpin, 1 votes)</a><br>
<font color="#FFC840">
Abaddon: Right now, it's just EviLDeD and myself<br>
Abaddon: we're the only 2 coders who are working on the UOX3 source base, which as you can imagine, makes it kind of tough at times :><br>
Abaddon: However, EviLDeD has been working on an application form, because we would like to take on a few more coders (3) in the not too distant future<br>
Abaddon: But we would like quality, not quantity<br>
Abaddon: For all those who are interested, please brush up on your C++ and your UOX3 code, it'll help, trust me :></font></p>

<p><a name="Q7">I've heard tell that Cironian is going to branch back off with UOX and do his own thing... any truth to that? (TailSpin, 1 votes)</a><br>
<font color="#FFC840">
EviLDeD: I myself have not heard this but in the current state of affairs I imagine that I would be one of the last to hear. If this rumor is true that I bid all the best to Cironian, adn his team and hope that he can pull off what
a lot of others have tried and not succeeded. This project started way back with a guy names Jagermister(sp), and was passed along thelines to cironian, etc. It has taken a long time to reach its current standing<br>
EviLDeD: Another quality emu to compete against just makes the community stronger, and better on a whole as long as its done with respect, and honor so to speak. I speak for myself in this
response, Ab might feel diff, but that's up to him to detail<br>
EviLDeD: so in short I wish him luck in any endeavours he partakes in. Him = Cironian</font></p>

<p><a name="Q8">What recent features have been added to UOX? (Lucus, 1 votes)</a><br>
<font color="#FFC840">
Abaddon: Well, there haven't been. That's what the current standing feature freeze is about<br>
Abaddon: However, we hope to lift the feature freeze condition in the next few weeks or so when we make a big release<br>
Abaddon: Until then, you'll just have to be a little patient<br>
EviLDeD: I was thinking when 1.0 releases<br>
EviLDeD: the freeze will be over.<br>
EviLDeD: but no guarantees</font></p>

<p><a name="Q9">Will you be adding programs to make custom weapons like Lightsabres. (JohnnyRingo, 1 votes)</a><br>
<font color="#FFC840">
EviLDeD: Well I am not up to swing on all the current events, but the Official uox3 ToolTeam was
started and is head up by Decius. The goal of this team is to create tools such as this.<br>
EviLDeD: Eventually I would like to think that there will be 3rd party tools that will replace images, and or add images, as
well as streamline their exchange from server to client.<br>
Zippy-: There are already a few tools that can add various things to the muls (like items, or houses) floating around....<br>
Zippy-: if you know a little VB, you could play with Decius' OCX for art.mul.<br>
Chaos: Also, there are a TON of scripts that have neat little items in them, you can find the scripts from
<a href="http://www.uoxdev.com"> www.uoxdev.com</a></font></p>

<p><font color="#800080">MACHINE REBOOT</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFC840">
EviLDeD: Well personally I think that uox has developed a community spirit all on its own, long past uo's demise as you put it, uox,
and sphere, and other emu will live on and survive past as they are evolving, and
capture the true heart of the gamer. I think that we will continue long past the *cough* demise of UO</font></p>

<p><a name="Q10">Will we possibly see added support for automatic NPC-driven quests in game? (Rayin[TCE], 1 votes)</a><br>
<font color="#FFC840">
EviLDeD: If I understand this question correctly, the answer would be yes. AI will be scriptable, so technically the
mind's the limit here. If you are talking about in game pre made (hardcoded) quest npc, I guess if a good and solid enough
script (story line) for the quest, and the npcs was provided and was passed putting in a defined set of hardcoded
quester NPC could be possible.</font></p>

<p><a name="Q11">Since my shard is almost done, when you update UOX3 will I have to redo everything on my shard? (Kazuki|Shard, 1 votes)</a><br>
<font color="#FFC840">
Abaddon: The simple and quickest answer to that is really... no<br>
Abaddon: Tools will be provided to migrate across any macro level changes, and UOX will handle the micro level stuff<br>
Abaddon: QuestionBot: Is monster AI coded into the client, or within UOX itself? On this line, do you foresee any improvements in monster
behaviour while in combat? (Tom, 1 votes)<br>
Abaddon: It's coded into UOX, most certainly<br>
Abaddon: and as to answer your second question... think Olympic motto type stuff... "faster, higher, better"<br>
Abaddon: Yes, I foresee it<br>
Abaddon: (for those that don't know, I'm Australian, so it was... I guess... kinda nationalistic :>)</font></p>

<p><a name="Q12">Why don't we get the web stuff a little more organized... one second its uox.stratics.com then its uoxdev.com now I hear its going to be something else... why not just stick with one and STAY.... uox.stratics.com sucks, and then uoxdev.com alright I guess, but now another site (TailSpin)</a><br>
<font color="#FFC840">
EviLDeD: I have to agree, as do a lot of others about the state of uox.stratics.com. uoxdev.com is the best source to obtain information on most facets of uox3, from tools, scripts, exe's,
humour etc.<br>
EviLDeD: as well as other emulators closely related to the uox project.<br>
EviLDeD: the other site that you are hearing about would be www.uox3.net. This sites goal is to provide a tight, and informative
resource for things directly related to the Official uox3 DevTeam. Schedule, release dates, etc.<br>
EviLDeD: This site is not completed to time restraints. However will be up as soon as a few of the core
components are completed.</font></p>

<p><a name="Q13">Will UOX not be adding stupid shit... IE: IRC servers to their emu? (TailSpin, 1 votes)</a><br>
<font color="#FFC840">
EviLDeD: Well. Stupid shit was harsh. to answer you though "No there will be no stupid shit like irc servers added". However give Sphere and
Westy due credit the idea behind the irc server is a sound one for questers, and people that wish to deal the mechanics for characters that are in game. or to possible send commands to the core etc in a irc
chat room.<br>
EviLDeD: it is a solid idea, however not one that uox3 will be adopting anytime too soon</font></p>

<p><a name="Q14">"the web thing will be awesome and I'd like to add, "when will it be up" hehe and just to say that I am back! *evil my wub bucket :" by Cy with 1 votes</a><br>
<font color="#FFC840">
EviLDeD: Once again as soon as I get a hard drive and get all back set up and running. give or take a couple weeks. I
like to have things working as well as I can before pulling down my pants and showing my ass... :))<br>
EviLDeD: On behalf of the Official DevTeam I would like to thank all of you that attended
tonight's meeting. Without your feedback and support there would be no real reason to do any of this.. We look forward to seeing you at the next meeting. Sept 3, 8:00pm
mst (gmt -7)<br>
EviLDeD: Feel free to linger around, there is coffee at the back of the room.....</font></p>
