<center><h2>How do I create a playable orc race?</h2></center>
<p>Orc race, daemon race, cat race, dog race are all possible. But any graphic other than human will make your paperdoll blank. 

<p>You will have to guess where swords are, or armor or cloths and they also won't show on your character in game. 

<p>So beware... 

<p>First make a gate or some item to change the player 
<p>'ADDITEM 2523 

<p>Now set it to a monster gate 
<p>'SETTYPE 82 

<p>Now set it to the type of monster you want 
<p>'setmorex # //#= the npc number in npc.scp 

<p>So an orc would be 
<p>'setmorex 69
