<center><h2>Why does my client stop at "Verifying" or "connecting" ?</h2></center>
<p>There might be several reasons for this. Here are some of the things that may cause these problems: 

<h3>When halting at Verifying Account:</h3>

<ul><li>You have put the UOX port (2593) behind your IP adress in UOX3.INI. Remove the Port adress from UOX3.INI 
<li>You are using the wrong UO Client, or the wrong UOX version. Download the latest of both of these. 
<li>You are not using "Ignition" to start the UO client 
</ul>
<h3>When halting at "Connecting":</h3>

<ul><li>You haven't put the UOX port (2593) behind your IP adress in LOGIN.CFG. Add the port to LOGIN.CFG, so it says "LoginServer=my.ip.adress,2593" (replace my.ip.adress with your ip adress ;P) 

<li>You have put the wrong IP in either LOGIN.CFG or UOX3.INI. Make sure you have the same IP adress in 
both of these files, and also make sure the IP adress is valid. Most computers use 127.0.0.1 as local IP 
adress, or "loopback ip" as it is also called. Use this if you want to play offline, locally on your own 
computer.<br>
Else, use WINIPCFG to find your LAN/Internet IP if you intend to use either of those. 
<li>The Client or the UOX3 server is behind a Firewall which is not set up to let the connections through. 
</ul>
