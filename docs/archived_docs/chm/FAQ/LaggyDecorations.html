<center><h2>Help! My decorations are causing lots of log! What do I do?</h2></center>
<p>Well, fortunately, there has been a program written for this named Worldforge. Worldforge serves three functions: 

<h4>1. Freezing: </h4>
<p>This function allows you to add your decorations to your statics0.mul. This would make your new buildings internals, so not only is your lag cut down, your can also use circle of transparency on them. Freezing will save type, position, and hue. 

<h4>2. Melting: </h4>
<p>This function allows you to remove 8x8 blocks in order to delete them or edit them, where you can freeze them back into place. You can only melt 1 block at a time, so don't do this while you have players on your shard. 

<h4>3. Map Editing: </h4>
<p>Maybe if you're like me, or you're espescially into it, like Xuri, you don't like the current map. With this, you can maybe take a section of greenacres and build your world there. With that new BMP->MAP program and this combined, you can do practically anything you wish to the other part... but there'll be alot of statics. 

<p>So, anyway, what we want to do is freeze. There are two methods of doing this: 

<p>Type 255- WF checks the worldfiles for all items with an itemtype of 255. This works well if you only wanna freeze certain things then delete the rest. 

<p>Autofreeze- This will check your worldfiles and it'll freeze everything that is not named, is not in objection with the autoselect.txt (meaning it will have a # before it), and is not given a type, morex, or such. 

<p>Well, you want to supply the filepaths for each of the requested files. Then, it'll go in and freeze in the mode you put it in. I recommend you start with a clean worldfile. Your statics should be changed. Distribute amongst your players, zipped it should only be 7 meg.
