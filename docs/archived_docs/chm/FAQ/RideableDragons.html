<center><h2>How can I make dragons rideable?</h2></center>
<p>You cannot. 

<p>The only solution that has been really realized so far is replacing on each user-client a horse graphics with modified dragon sprites. 

<p>All other talking like server-side entrainment of a second creature with the player are only theoretic, and I doubt them to be ever possible. And even if it could function every one agrees that it would be very ineffective and lag prone. 

<p>Also from what I know of the client I believe it would look terrible wrong in all action animations. 

<p>Rumors are around that OSI themselves already wanted to make them rideable and failed. Maybe with Third Dawn they've reserved themselfes (and so also for us <img src="icon_smile.gif">) a possibily for hauler-dragons.
