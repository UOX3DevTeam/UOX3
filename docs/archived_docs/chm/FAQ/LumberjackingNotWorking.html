<center><h2>Why doesn't lumberjacking work on my shard?</h2></center>
<p>My guess is that it works, but whoever reports it as not working are trying to do it while they have transparency in the UO client enabled... and that means they target the ground behind the tree instead of the tree itself.. 

<p>Oh and one needs to target the TRUNK of the tree, not the leaves.
