<center><h2>How do I run UOX behind a firewall?</h2></center>
<ul><li>First the one and only port used by UOX is 2593. 
<li>You need to make this port transparent on your firewall. (How to do this depends on the kind of your firewall) 
<li>The error most people do, is that they put their internal IP adress into uox3.ini, connecting to the server from outside fails then. 
<p>Each UO login consists of actually two connects, the first one to the login server, where the user receives the list of game servers and their IP addresses (this are the ones from the uox3.ini) 
<p>The client then drops connection the server and starts the second one to the IP it got from the server. (Which is for UOX normally the same server again) 

<p>Now it's logical why the second connection fails if it's you internal IP. 

<li>If you want to also connect from your internal network to your shard, put entries into your uox3 server like: 
<pre>
MyShard 
47.11.8.15 
MyShard (internal only) 
192.168.1.7 
### 
</pre>
</ul>

<p>You select then the second game server for internal connections, all others have to select the primary one. <p><i>Knox</i></p>
