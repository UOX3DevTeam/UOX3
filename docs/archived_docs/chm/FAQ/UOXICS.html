<center><h2>How do I get UOX to work with Internet Connection Sharing?</h2></center>
<p>While not a common problem, it is one that has been asked from time to time. 

<p>Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) is essentially a NAT/Proxy server designed by Microsoft for "ease of use" for non-technical users. However "ease of use" in this case means "lack of control". ICS does not have an type of configuration settings that you can modify. By default, ICS blocks all inbound requests that are not initiated by your computer. What's this mean? It means people cannot log into your uox server. To get around this, you have to manually open port 2593, the port UOX uses. The following text is a configuration file for use with ICS.

<p>Copy everything between the "---" into a new text file and name it "uox4ics.inf" 
<p>Then right-click on the new file and select "install". Once you reboot, people should be able to log into your shard.
