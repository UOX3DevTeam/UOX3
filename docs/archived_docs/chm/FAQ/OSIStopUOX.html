<center><h2>What did OSI do to stop UOX?</h2></center>
<p>Almost nothing <img src="icon_smile.gif"> In fact they don't care much, as we are all only small fishes compared to their user base. 
(I believe that all shards from all emu's togehter don't even reach in size a single bigger OSI shard) 

<p>They are changing the encryption roughly every 6 months. But more motivated by keeping people from cheating at their servers as to stop emulators. At last since Ignition we know for sure that we are not targeted by this, as thanks due to ignition encryption changes no longer harm UOX  <img src="icon_smile.gif"> 

<p>Rumors say that OSI did put their hands on lawyers as soon some shards started to charge money, and they did interfere as some sphere-shards distrebuted their client.exe. 

<p>If I let my phantasies fly, thinking about what everything _could_ be done, I can only say that, if I would be in charge at OSI for stopping emu's, they all would be already be long faded out of memory  <img src="icon_smile.gif"> 

<p>However once again to point out, these theoretical actions would never justify a single win/cost calculation in any way.
