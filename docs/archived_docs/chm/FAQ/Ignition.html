<center><h2>What is Ignition? And why do I need it?</h2></center>
<p>Well some background: by default UO uses an encrypted protocol, and this encrpytion changes also from time to time. 

<p>Before ignition UOX always had to knew and understand the latest encryption, whitch forced to have all your users the same client version and it also took long development cycles until the latest encryption was hacked. 

<p>UOX does now no longer pester itself with encrpytion, instead a tool (ignition) modifies your client in memory, so it sends the protocoll unencrypted. 

<p>Modifing it in memory allows you to play on the same time with UOX shards, without destroying your ability to also play normally with OSI. 

<p>To be able to correctly modify the client, ignition has to know how this particular one is constructed. This info is stored in the ignition.cfg files, that's the reason you always need a new version of this textfile, whenever OSI patches their client. 

<p>(So you'll have to wait some days, until someone disambles the client, evaluating the new adresses needed to "patch" your client)
