<center><h2>What Is UOX?</h2></center>
UOX stands for <b>U</b>ltima <b>O</b>ffline E<b>x</b>periment and is an Ultima Online server emulator. The name is mostly historic, however a name change just for the beauty of it, is out of range. 

<p>With UOX you can: 
<ul>
<li> Play with your UO client offline at home. 
<li> Play on your local LAN with your friends. 
<li> Serve on the internet with your own shard, where others can connect to. 
</ul>
<p>It's Open Source (GPL), meaning that you can freely redistrebute and create your own derivates as long you also share your souce code. 

<p>UOX has a lot of features, is frequently updated & improved. It was one of the first (if not the very first) server emulators around, and in the years it has still influenced and inspired all other emu's in a major way.
