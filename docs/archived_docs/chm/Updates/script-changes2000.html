<p>What's new since v37c+:

<ul>
<li>CHANGES:
	<ul><li>ALL FILES
		<ul><li>Updated the version number heh :)</ul>
	<li>ITEMS.SCP
		<ul><li>The AR values of the "Gem Armors" has been halved (I think) - by Thaliq

		<li>Player Vendor Deed added (Item 50005), also added to MISC section of Deeds addmenu.
		<li>A number of items have been removed from the scripts, most of those are
		 items such as "Viking of Flamestrike/Mace of Resurrection" etcetra, as I don't think
		 they are really used by that many people. And those who do use them can readd the items
		 themselves.
		 <p>List of items removed:<br>
		  10158 -> 10185<br>
		  20004 -> 20014<br>

<li>FIXES:
	<ul><li>ITEMS.SCP

		 24, as this was the wrong LAYER for these items.
		<li>All shields have been set to ITEMHAND 3 (used by shields only) so two handed weapons can no longer
		 be equiped along with them (bow & shield for instance).
		 Likewise, all two-handed weapons have been set to ITEMHAND 2 and all one handed weapons to ITEMHAND 1. 
		<li>Weapons & shields should now have the correct LAYER values.
		<li>Handheld lantern/torch should now have the correct layer allowing you to hold it along with a weapon.</ul>

<p>Ok Eagle here is all I have done :) below this general description 
you will find the file specific information :)

<ul><li>I checked and or fixed everything existing so it now works. (except furniture destroying....gotta do that yet)
<li>I tweaked fish skinning to work better
<li>frying aggs and fish now works better than ever...
<li>you must use heat on food then it checks for needs :)
<li>All cooking will follow this format (or should)
<li>Use flame on food to cook :)
</ul>
<p>This will allow triggers to be made for using pots, spits, etc
and will keep the process uniform..so you basically know how to cook without having to have a cooking manual :O hehe
Also whoever added the deeding cannons to wtrg.scp...it can be done in a better fashion,(similiar to the way cooking is done) to allow
for not only redeeding, but cleaning, and firing as well...the way its currently done, will not allow for the cleaning or firing.
I would be glad to work with whoever did it to help out :)

<ul><li>wtrgs.scp 
<ul><li>A total rewrite...
<li>I fixed everything except the destroying furniture part :)
<li>Harvesting from fruit trees is now possible.
<li>Spinning flax, skinning fish, filling empty bookshelves etc.
<li>I added a new triggers (ie: frying fish).
</ul>
<p>Just replace the old wtrg.scp. Its totally redone :)
<li>Item.scp
<ul><li>for fishing I added a new Itemlist....Itemlist 57.
<li>It allows you to catch all four variety of fish :)
<li>I also had to add a few items to do it. 
<li>They are the different types of fish.
<ul>
<li>ITEM 40000
<li>ITEM 40001
<li>ITEM 40002
<li>ITEM 40003
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
In order to fry eggs I had to edit item #5043 (raw eggs)
I made it so it triggers...you can eat them raw or cook them 
in a frypan :O

<li>trigger.scp

<p>Had to add three triggers for cooking eggs.
<ul>
<li>TRG 123 - breaking and eating raw eggs
<li>TRG 124 - breaking & cooking the eggs in frypan
<li>TRG 125 - removing the eggshells
</ul>
<li>create.scp

<p>I had to change Retalins Baking menu to get it to work.
<br>SECTION MAKEMENU 100
<br>just paste in the new one :)
<p>

<li>envoke.scp
<ul><li>Its a total rewrite (albeit a small one) 
<li>I fixed alot of the envokes.
<li>The formats were wrong on some of them & I also added some new ones.
