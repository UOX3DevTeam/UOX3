</ul>
 

 

<h2>29th July, 2001 (Build 0.95.03.01)</h2>

<br>eg
<br><pre>SECTION JAILS
{
X 5276
Y 1164
Z 0	// Jail 1
X 5286
Y 1164
Z 0	// Jail 2
}</pre>
<li>Added InRange and OutOfRange support for characters
<li>Added periodic sound playback and item creation delays into create.scp.  Use the DELAY # tag in an item in create.scp where # is number secs * 100.  So 1 sec == 100. Use the SOUND # tag to specify what sound to play every 3 seconds, where # is a hex number.
<li>Added UO3D mount support (some are stlil wrong)
<li>Added weapon damage support
<li>Added deletechar command to delete a PC
</ul>
<ul>Notes

<li>Add menu now displays the menu #

<li>It will no longer be possible to engrave most items (gold, corpses and such)
<li>Stealing will now depend on player's AR
<li>Significant code cleanups
</ul>
<ul>Additions
<li>Added onEnterRegion and onLeaveRegion events
<li>Added GetClientVersion and GetClientType SE functions
<li>Added GetTileIDAtMapCoord SE function
<li>Added SCRIPT tag to items.scp and npc.scp
<li>Linux source compatability (requires GCC 2.96 or above, as 2.95 doesn't support anonymouse unions)
</ul>
<ul>Notes
<li>The create.scp will mostly not work currently as it is geared towards the definition system, and thus most things won't work correctly
</ul>

<h2>02nd July, 2001 (Build 0.95.01)</h2>

<ul>Notes
<li>This is the first binary publicly available built upon the 0.95 source base. Note that there are a number of things left to be done and there are known issues. Noteably, the make menu is being overhauled and updated to a new system. 
</ul>

<h2>10th April, 2001 (Build 24a)</h2>


<ul><li>Beneficial spells (Heal, Night Sight, Agility, Cunning, Cure, Protection, Strength, Bless, Greater Heal, Inivisibility ) on murderers will flag you criminal
<li>Races constructor/destructor modified to not cause crashes
<li>Fixed inability to repeatedly cast magic
<li>Fixed cannot use items equipped on other players bug
<li>Shitlist read in as a vector at startup, and run through in memory on login
<li>F key on console will reload the shitlist.ini file
<li>Cannot hide while mounted
<li>Attempting to resurrect a murderer via bandages results in criminality
<li>Attempting to cure a murderer via bandages results in criminality
<li>Attempting to heal a murderer via bandages results in criminality
<li>If you don't have the skill to heal a character, it tells you that you apply the bandages but it barely helps.  Their health only goes up by 1 HP.
<li>If somehow on horse while stealthing, will go out of stealth when attempting to walk
<li>Few pathfinding corrections (fleeing NPCs work better)
<li>Slight change to teleport, may fix black liche thing
<li>Stack being refreshed when items added to it
<li>If hidden when mounting a horse, become unhidden
<li>When mounting, creature attacking the mount will stop attacking.  Mount will lose any target they may have.
<li>Slight changes to readw3(), to prevent overruns.
<li>Explicit NULLing of files when closed.
<li>Races added a new tag, to help streamline scripts.  PARENTRACE # where # is the parent race.  This essentially is just a cut/paste job
</ul>
<pre>
ie
SECTION RACE 0 // Just happens to be the parent
{
NAME Human
STRCAP 150
DEXCAP 30
INTCAP 120
PLAYERRACE 1
}

SECTION RACE 1
{
PARENTRACE 0	// by using this, they automatically get strcap of 150, dexcap of 30, and intcap of 120, as well as being a player race with the name Human
NAME Midget	// we override the name given to us
DEXCAP 60	// increase the dexterity cap
}

In essence, you can picture race 1 being like:

SECTION RACE 1
{
NAME Human
STRCAP 150
DEXCAP 30
INTCAP 120
PLAYERRACE 1
NAME Midget
DEXCAP 60
}
</pre>
<p>This allows you to streamline races, if you need to.  You can extend this to grandchildren, or grand gran children, if so desired.  If you have a group of classes belonging to a race, then all the common aspects of those classes could be put in a parent race, and specialize in the child race.

<h2>9th April, 2001 (Build 24)</h2>

<p>Network.cpp refresh for linux only.  Corrects structure issues involved with firewalling

<h2>7th April, 2001 (Build 24)</h2>

<li>str2num internally calls atoi
<li>Murder dcay timer reset on world load (to fix possible timer issues on both win and lin)
<li>NPCs talk out loud, so that all can hear
<li>IFRACE trigger added
	<p>eg IFRACE #	// # is a race number from races.scp
	<br>Used for item triggers
<li>Changes to HTML status pages
	<p>Addition of player information
	<br>New section in htmlstrm.scp
	<br>SECTION DIRECTORY
	<br>{
	<br>C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\guilds	// Guilds physical directory
	<br>C:\inetpub\wwwroot\player	// Player physical directory
	<br>C:\inetpub\wwwroot\images	// Images physical directory
	<br>/guilds				// web server guild location
	<br>/player				// web server player location
	<br>/images				// web server images location
	<br>}
	<br>In section guild_main, only one file entry now.  Put name of file name, it will automatically attach guilds directory in front of it
	<br>So if it used to be c:\inetpub\wwwroot\guilds\guilds.htm, it would now just be guilds.htm
	<br>So it looks kinda like
	<br>SECTION GUILD_MAIN
	<br>{
	<br>guilds.htm
	<br>LINE <HTML>
	<br>LINE </HTML>
	<br>}
	<br>New section, PLAYERPAGE
	<br>The valid tags player specific are:
	<br>NAME	// player's name
	<br>STR	// player's strength
	<br>DEX	// player's dex
	<br>INT	// player's intelligence
	<br>KILLS	// player's kills
	<br>RACE	// player's race (name)
	<br>TITLE	// player's title
	<br>TIME	// real world time
	<br>FAME	// player's fame (number)
	<br>KARMA	// player's karma (number)
	<br>PROWESSTITLE	// Grand Master, and so forth
	<br>NOTOTITLE	// noto title (ie Infamous, Glorious, and so on)
	<br>SKILLTITLE	// bowyer, fletcher, skill title
	<br>TOPSKILLS #	// # is the number of skills to show

	<br>Player HTML is dumped out if HTML generation is on, and dumped at world save / player login
<li>IP Firewalling
	<p>New file added into uox3 shard directory, shitlist.ini.  This CAN be empty if so desired
	<br>Format:
	<br>x.x.x.x	// x can either be a number or a *

	<br>eg
	<br>192.168.0.*	// disconnects any from that subnet
	<br>127.*.*.*	// all localhost disconnected
	<br>1.2.3.4		// specific host disconnected
	
	<br>This will disconnect a client before processing anything
