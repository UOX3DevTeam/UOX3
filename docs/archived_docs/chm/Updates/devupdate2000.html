<h1>Updates file</h1>
<h2>6th December, 2000 (Build 20f)</h2>

<ul><li>Think fixed stat bug due to dying (needs testing)
<li>Fixed auto account creation bug (password not saving)
<li>NPCs can dispel creatures, bit 17 of SPAttack (KKung)
<li>Items with a DEF of 0 will not be destroyable in combat (Xuri)
<li>Fixed that nasty vial usage bug which would totally corrupt your character
<li>Put in tweak so that AI 2 and not race 0 will attack other AI 2 (subject to other rules, like racial allies)
<li>Veterinary skill used in healing/curing/resurrecting nonhuman body types (Xuri)
<li>Can't train past the skill cap (KKung)
<li>Status bars should work correctly in combat
<li>Can only be interrupted during a spell while casting, not after getting target cursor
</ul>

<h2>23rd November, 2000 (Build 20e TR2)</h2>

<ul><li>Believe the 2 on 1 attacker bug is now finally solved
<li>More walking revisions from Knox
<li>Fixed being frozen when casting spell and getting target cursor bug
</ul>
<p>(Knox: One thing that happened with the merge, was that you lost the ability for things to swim and things to fly.  My guess
is that a lot of the tile comparisons are done based on movement type.  ie some things won't block for fish that will for people
so I imagine we need to figure out how to make use of CanGMWalk(), CanNPCWalk(), CanFishWalk() and what not)

<h2>9th October, 2000 (Build 19c)</h2>
<h3>DevTeam Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Guard attack delay bug should be fixed
<li>Spell interruption should occur for all spells that do damage
<li>Reputation flagging of other creatures should be greatly improved
<li>Monsters of AI type 2 now search a scriptable distance for targets.  SECTION COMBAT and the MAXRANGE value determines how far away a monster considers a "valid" target.  AI type 2 updated so they won't attack their owner, and there's a slim (less than 10%) chance they'll attack their own race if not the default race.  Also, they will not attack racial allies.
<li>Magic Spellbook memory reduction
<p>NOTE: We have limited legacy spellbook support.  As long as you don't add a spell to your spellbook, your old spellbooks should continue to work, but as soon as you add the first spell to it, only that spell will be in it (switches to new spellbook type).  To the GMs out there, I would find all your players with spellbooks, take note of the spells they have, and construct new spellbooks for them, deleting the old ones.  It also allows for spellbooks to be "prefilled".  The new spellbook layout is like this:

<p>MOREX, MOREY and MOREZ are reserved on spellbooks.  Each is a 32 bit word, representing a possible 32 spells each word.  So the traditional spellbook is represented by MOREX and MOREY only.  MOREX contains info on circles 1->4, and MOREY on circles 5->8. Think of each of these as a 32 bit long BINARY number.  An empty spellbook would look like: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 Those are your 4 circles.  Each circle has 8 bits.  Circle 4 is on the left, circle 1 is on the right.  Within a circle, the spells count down from left to right.  ie 10000000 In this case, the person has spell 8.

<p>For windows users, it is easy to setup the scripts.  Open up windows calc, set it to scientific mode.  Choose binary.  Now fill in the spell configuration you want for a spellbook (we'll use an example of spells 1 and 3 in circles 1->4).  It would look like this: 00000101 00000101 00000101 00000101  Now hit the decimal radio button, and it will convert it back to base 10.  You should get the number 84215045.  Put this in the MOREX section, and the spellbook is prefilled!  That's circles 1->4, the same applies to 5->8 but it's for MOREY instead.
</ul>

<p>....
<br>and probably more, it's too late to be thinking coherently
<br>/**********************/
<br>What does the STATADVANCE number do? Simply put, this number represents the percent chance that the stat associated with a skill that is used will 
go up by one. Each increment of 1 is a 1/10th percent chance. Example: To give players a 4% chance of raising a stat set this number to 40. The default
value of this setting is 20, or a 2% chance. (players would be lucky to gain 1 stat point in a day) Setting this number to 0 will disable stat
advancement completely. A setting of 20 is fairly close to the advancement rate seen from build 19a and earlier. To slow things down to a more
OSI-like setting, set this value to a range between 7 and 10.

it PLEASE take a look at it, it's got me stumped completely       (Abaddon)
<li>Removed a nasty crash where AddRespawnNPC would open, but not close
the npc.scp.  After a long enough period, it died, causing a server crash.

due to the fact that with VC 5 deleting that array caused a crash
This way it's cleaner, code's easier, and works just as well
Tested with 3 open doors, curse, strength and agility all at once (Abaddon)
</ul>
<h2>10th February, 2000</h2>

<ul><li>Fix so that you can't equip a 2 handed weapon when already
having equipped a single-handed one                         	(Abaddon)

<li>Public member of accounts added					(EvilDeD)
<li>Reduced item_st by a further 156 bytes.  Desc member of item_st
was 256 bytes.  The only way this was written to was via speech
and the client won't allow that long a string to be typed in
so we can relatively safely assume we don't need 256 bytes and
that 100 is likely to be sufficient                         	(Abaddon)
<li>Item's desc field saved/loaded to/from disk                 	(Abaddon)

<h2>9th February, 2000</h2>

<ul><li>Took out talkingto[], spattackvalue[], oldserials[], and contcache[]. These arrays did NOTHING, just taking up space....							(Zippy)
Changed loscache[] and itemids[] to static 1000 size arrays.  This is PLENTY for them, they did NOT need to be itemcount size, they could even be smaller.			(Zippy)
(Depends on the area size, and whether people use a lot of tiles there's a distinct chance you could exceed 1000)
<li>A few more boat fixes						(Zippy)
<li>Reduced item & char struct sizes a bit.(use CHARs, and SHORTs)	(Zippy)
</ul>

<h2>8th February, 2000</h2>

<li>MoveToBag command works once again                              (Abaddon)
<li>Redeeding a house now removes all keys attached to it, and 
generates a proper player vendor deed for each vendor.  However,
note when you place that vendor again his name will change.     (Abaddon)
</ul>
<h2>23rd January, 2000</h2>

<ul><li>Removed an archiving crash

</ul>
<h2>22nd January, 2000</h2>

<ul><li>Fixed a bug where if you smithed an item, but dropped your ingots
between choosing the ingot and the item to make, it would make
the item without removing the ingots. You must have the ingots
in your pack now.                                               (Abaddon/Ripper)
<li>Added support for Fame/Karma tags in advancement objects        (Abaddon)

<li>Doubleclicking on door of house you own when locked works again (Abaddon)
<li>Dropping a scroll on a spellbook puts it in the spellbook       (Abaddon)
(This wasn't working, it was never updating new cont serial)
<li>Fixed a bug so that you only need your key in your pack to open your house if the door is locked                                (Abaddon)
<ul>
<p>MENTAL NOTE:  Spellbooks are done horribly.  Right now, a full spell book has 64 items within it, and that seems
wasteful when you start to scale the books up a lot.  One option is to have a series of fields, you'd only need
8 bytes, 9 for extras potentially, and there is one bit for each spell, present or absent.  Granted, if the spells
ever increase in number, then you'll need to add more fields to support the larger number of spells, but I think
that the size decrease tradeoff would be quite significant.  Item_st is fairly big, and to remove 64 of them and
replace them with 8 bytes seems like a boon.  Then again, there may not be that many spellbooks in the world either.
Just a consideration. (Abaddon)
