		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2, June 1991
		<p>&nbsp;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
		<br>&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
		<br>&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble
		<p>&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
		<br>freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public
		<br>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
		<br>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&nbsp; This
		<br>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
		<br>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
		<br>using it.&nbsp; (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
		<br>the GNU Library General Public License instead.)&nbsp; You can apply it to
		<br>your programs, too.
		<p>&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
		<br>price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
		<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
		<br>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
		<br>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
		<br>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
		<p>&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
		<br>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
		<br>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
		<br>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
		<p>&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
		<br>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
		<br>you have.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
		<br>source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their
		<br>rights.
		<p>&nbsp; We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
		<br>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
		<br>distribute and/or modify the software.
		<p>&nbsp; Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
		<br>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
		<br>software.&nbsp; If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
		<br>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
		<br>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
		<br>authors' reputations.
		<p>&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
		<br>patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
		<br>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
		<br>program proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
		<br>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
		<p>&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
		<br>modification follow.
		<br>&nbsp;
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
		<p>&nbsp; 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
		<br>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
		<br>under the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp; The "Program", below,
		<br>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
		<br>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
		<br>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
		<br>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
		<br>language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
		<br>the term "modification".)&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".
		<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
		<br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of
		<br>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
		<br>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
		<br>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
		<br>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
		<p>&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
		<br>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
		<br>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
		<br>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
		<br>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
		<br>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
		<br>along with the Program.
		<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
		<br>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
		<p>&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
		<br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
		<br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
		<br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties under the terms of this License.
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
		<br>&nbsp;
		<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If
		<br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
		<br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
		<br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
		<br>sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you
		<br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
		<br>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
		<br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
		<br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
		<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
		<br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
		<br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
		<br>collective works based on the Program.
		<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
		<br>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
		<br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
		<br>the scope of this License.
		<p>&nbsp; 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
		<br>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
		<br>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange; or,
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute corresponding source code.&nbsp; (This alternative is
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the program in object code or executable form with such
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
		<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
		<br>making modifications to it.&nbsp; For an executable work, complete source
		<br>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
		<br>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
		<br>control compilation and installation of the executable.&nbsp; However, as a
		<br>special exception, the source code distributed need not include
		<br>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
		<br>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
		<br>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
		<br>itself accompanies the executable.
		<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
		<br>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
		<br>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
		<br>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
		<br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
		<br>&nbsp;
		<p>&nbsp; 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
		<br>except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt
		<br>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
		<br>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
		<br>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
		<br>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
		<br>parties remain in full compliance.
		<p>&nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
		<br>signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
		<br>distribute the Program or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are
		<br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by
		<br>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
		<br>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
		<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
		<br>the Program or works based on it.
		<p>&nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
		<br>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
		<br>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
		<br>these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further
		<br>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
		<br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
		<br>this License.
		<p>&nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
		<br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
		<br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
		<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
		<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot
		<br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
		<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
		<br>may not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent
		<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
		<br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
		<br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
		<br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
		<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
		<br>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
		<br>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
		<br>circumstances.
		<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
		<br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
		<br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
		<br>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
		<br>implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made
		<br>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
		<br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
		<br>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
		<br>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
		<br>impose that choice.
		<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
		<br>be a consequence of the rest of this License.
		<br>&nbsp;
		<p>&nbsp; 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
		<br>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
		<br>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
		<br>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
		<br>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
		<br>countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates
		<br>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
		<p>&nbsp; 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
		<br>of the General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will
		<br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
		<br>address new problems or concerns.
		<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Program
		<br>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
		<br>later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
		<br>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
		<br>Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of
		<br>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
		<br>Foundation.
		<p>&nbsp; 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
		<br>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
		<br>to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is copyrighted by the Free
		<br>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
		<br>make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our decision will be guided by the two goals
		<br>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
		<br>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY
		<p>&nbsp; 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
		<br>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN
		<br>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
		<br>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
		<br>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
		<br>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS
		<br>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE
		<br>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
		<br>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
		<p>&nbsp; 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
		<br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
		<br>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
		<br>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
		<br>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
		<br>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
		<br>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
		<br>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
		<br>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		<br>&nbsp;
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
		<p>&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
		<br>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
		<br>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
		<p>&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest
		<br>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
		<br>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
		<br>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) 19yy&nbsp; &lt;name of author>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
		<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
		<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
		<br>when it starts in an interactive mode:
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
		<p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
		<br>parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, the commands you use may
		<br>be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
		<br>mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
		<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
		<br>school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
		<br>necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:
		<p>&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
		<br>&nbsp; `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

		<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into

		<br>Public License instead of this License.
