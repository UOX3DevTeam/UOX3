Monsterattack!
--------------

I do this to create a kind of "war event" every once in a while.
It is a gate that spawns monster in masses and can be "closed"
by players touching (double clicking) it.
It can be any item but gates are good for making up a story =)
Nasty as we are we make it so that the first touch does not
remove the gate but spawns a few Ogre lords and hurts the player!

&gt;&gt;&gt; this goes into triggers.scp &lt;&lt;&lt;
SECTION TRG 128
{ Gyalseys monstergate trigger 1
RANGE 1
NADD 80
NADD 80
NADD 80
ACT 14
HEA -20
SND 00 54
MSG You fail to close the gate!
EMT *Your hands tremble*
SETID 0f 6c
NEWTRIG 129
DISABLE 30
}

SECTION TRG 129
{ Gyalseys monstergate trigger 2
RANGE 1
REMOVE
REMOVE
REMOVE
MSG You close the gate!
ACT 11
SND 00 F5
EMT *something on the ground catches your eye*
IADD 5131 0
}
&gt;&gt;&gt; end triggers.scp &lt;&lt;&lt;

Then you add a red moongate where you want the hordes
to flood in, make it a monster spawner and set the
trigger on it.
Here are the commands. Don't type the //remarks =)

'add 0d da    // add a red moongate
'setmovable 2 // only GMs can move it
'itrig 128    // set the trigger
'settype 62   // set it to monster spawner
'setmorex 250 // let it spawn from the orc-kin list from npc.scp
'setmorey 0   // make it spawn fast, 0-1 minute
'setmorez 1   // you can also make it faster by putting a 0 here
'setamount 30 // let it be 30 monsters max

Finished! Weeee, see how they beat up your players! ;-)


Now for some details:

Trigger 128:
RANGE 1
This makes that the player must be standing right
next to the gate to be able to "touch" it.
NADD 80
This spawns an Ogre Lord. The number is from npc.scp.
ACT 14
Makes the player perform a special move.
Here it is the "being hurt" move.
HEA -20
Lets the player take 20 damage!
SND 00 54
Play a sound.
SETID 0f 6c
NEWTRIG 129
Unfortunately setting the item to a new trigger
with NEWTRIG just works when you do a SETID
before! Here we use it to make the gate a blue gate
so the player actually sees that he has done something.
DISABLE 30
Disables the trigger for 30 seconds to keep the
players from rapid clicking the gate.

Trigger 129:
REMOVE
REMOVE
REMOVE
Well, removes the gate =)
You need to have the command a few times in the script.
Sometimes it doesn't work if you have it in only
one time. =/
IADD 5131 0
Give the player a reward. Here it is a magic chain coif.
Number 5131 is from items.scp and 0 lets it appear at
the players feet. 1 would be the players pack.
You could add this line multiple if you want to give
multiple items.


This should explain how you can make gates that spawn
every kind of monsters you want and give the players
any kind of reward you think that fits.

These are a great way to distract your players when
they nag about being bored at a weekend =)
