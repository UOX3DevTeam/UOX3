<center><h1>Gonda's UOGateway Tutorial</h1></center>

<p>Ok, UOGateway is probably the best tool out there for UOX shards with custom maps, statics, verdatas, etc. Seems to me the biggest problem is, and why its not as popular as it should be, is the fact that most people can not figure it out. So here it is; a straight forward tutorial cause I'm bored.

<p>If you don’t have UOGateway already, get it from this URL: <a href="http://www.uogateway.com">http://www.uogateway.com</a>.

<p>You will also need to have Winace, and an ftp server to host the files.
<br><a href="http://www.winace.com">www.winace.com</a>
<br><a href="http://www.tripod.com">www.tripod.com</a>

<p>In this package I have included the version of UOG patch that I use and a login.xml file.

<p>I’m also assuming you know how to use World Forge and have created the differential files and what not. If you have not or don’t know how to, stop here, and go read the world forge tutorial at <a href="http://www.uoxdev.com/wforgetutorial.html">http://www.uoxdev.com/wforgetutorial.html</a>.

<ol>
<li>Double-click on the uogpatch.exe file.
<li>In the setting tab point it to your original verdata mul (the no edited plain old OSI verdata mul)
<li>In Shard short name enter two letters of what your shard name is for ex... Dark Stone=DS
<li>Under MULs click on Add if you have created statics files, click on the statics button, and point the first two to your original unedited OSI static files, and point the last two to your the new ones you have created with world forge. Click on the add button
<li>If you have created a custom map do the same, in original point it to your original OSI map file, and in new point it to your new map file you have created. The click on the add button
<li>If you want to force all users to use the same client version as you, go to the client button and point it to the clinet.exe you wish to use. The click on the add button
<li>All the other files work in the same general fashion, first you point to regular OSI files, then you point to your new un-edited files. The click on the add button.
<li>Once you have all the files you want added, click on the create UOP button. This may take awhile, and it also may look like it has locked up, but it has not. Depending on how many files you added you might be there awhile.  I use the older version of Fixit’s patch program because I find the newer version usually gives me a runtime error overflow message all the time.
<li>Once it is finished you will see a file called PATCH.UOP. You will need to use WinAce on this file to compress it. USE ACE 1.0 COMPRESSION
<li>When you are done upload this compressed file to your server.
</ol>

<h3>The Login.xml</h3>

<ol>
<li>Right click on the login.xml file included in this package select open with, and choose notepad.
<li>You will see a series of places to put in information like below
<li>In between the IP tags, put the IP of your server whether it is numbers or just a dns2go address.
<li>In the patch version put in a 1 for your first patch, and every time you make and upload a new patch up this number by one.
<li>In between the patch-file tags put in the exact address to your patch file on your web-server so... http://www.tripod.com/patch.ace or whatever you named the patch-file, and where ever it is hosted.
<li>Send a copy of the login.xml to fixit so he can add you to the UOG public server listing. 
<li>Once your added, upload the login.xml to your ftp-server or web-server or whatever you’re using.
</ol>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
&lt;logins&gt;
  &lt;login&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;
Here you put in a greetings/info message that shows before the user logs in.
Remember not to use the bigger than, or lesser than signs as this will break the
Login-file, and your users wont be able to use it.
    &lt;/message&gt;
    &lt;ip&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/ip&gt;
    &lt;patchversion&gt;0&lt;/patchversion&gt;
    &lt;patchfile&gt;&lt;/patchfile&gt;
    &lt;encryption&gt;0&lt;/encryption&gt;
  &lt;/login&gt;
&lt;/logins&gt;
</pre>
Now what?

<p>Have all your players/GMs download UO gateway, then let them add your shard from the public listings.
<p>When they login using gateway it will auto-patch them, and not touch any OSI files.
<p>At times it may look like the gateway program has locked up during patching but it has not, depending on the size of the patch and the persons machine it may take awhile. 

<p>Note: I did not make any of these tools, nor do I claim to have. Each is the property of their respective creators.
