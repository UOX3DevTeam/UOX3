<center><h1>A guide to Custom Spellbooks</h1><h4>Written by: TWiG</h4></center>
<p>Last updated: 12th November, 2000</P>
<hr>
<P>This is a guide to help you build custom spellbooks with only the spells in them you want. These then can be given to the player from the start, and be the only spells they can use, if you dont have scrolls spawn in your world. This helps those that would like different spells for mages and clerics or other class/race ideas. Please read the whole page before undertaking this project.</P>
<p>Custom spellbook code stays about the same as the empty spellbooks, only the morex and morey changes. So your finnished custom spellbooks will look something like this in your items.scp file.</P>
<P>SECTION ITEM 9501<br>
{<br>
NAME a Mage Spellbook<br>
TYPE 9<br>
ID 0EFA<br>
SETPRIV 1<br>
DECAY<br>
VALUE 0<br>
GOOD 32<br>
MOREX 3974527919<br>
MOREY 1537195615<br>
MOREZ 0<br>
}</P>
<P>You will need to write out your spells in a "map" like this on paper or a txt file...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>00000000 4th circle }<BR>
00000000 3rd circle }--- morex<BR>
00000000 2nd circle }<BR>
00000000 1st circle }</P>
<P>00000000 8th circle }<BR>
00000000 7th circle }--- morey<BR>
00000000 6th circle }<BR>
00000000 5th circle }</P>
<P>^^^^^^^^<br>

SPELL order from spells.scp</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>0=OFF 1=ON</P>
<P>You will just set each spell to ON that you want to be in the book.</P>
<P>NOW... here is the werid part, setting the spells. Open up the calculator that comes with your OS, or get a GOOD scientific calc. set it to BINARY mode..</P>
<P>now.. look at the numbers for "morex", enter those numbers into the calc starting from top left going across then going on to the next line. Once that is all typed in hit the DECIMAL mode button, it will turn it into a whole number. This number becomes the "morex" value.</P>
<P>example--</P>
<P>10101011<BR>
01110000<BR>
10001010<BR>
10100001</P>
<P>would be 10101011011100001000101010100001 in BINARY<br>
translated to DECIMAL it would be 2876279457, so this would be my morex#.<br>
Do the same thing for the morey#</P>
<P>it sounds hard, but isnt after the first book.. &nbsp;  :)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><center><b>!!!!!! &nbsp; NOTE &nbsp; !!!!!!</B></center></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>the way the code works for 1st circle spells is not the order they are in spells.scp like all the other lines, this is how it registers...</P>
<P>this 00000000<BR>
=<BR>
these 86543217<BR>
not<BR>
these 87654321</P>
<P>these numbers translate to-<BR>
1 clumsy<BR>
2 create food<BR>
3 feeblemind<BR>
4 heal<BR>
5 magic arrow<BR>
6 night sight<BR>
7 reactive armor<BR>
8 weaken</P>
