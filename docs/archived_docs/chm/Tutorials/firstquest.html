How to set up a simple quest with triggers
------------------------------------------

First what the quest is all about:
Lesley the weaponsmith has lost her hammer while mining in the
caves and now she would reward anyone who finds her favourite tool
and brings it back to her.

I will first show the script parts needed and explain and comment
at the end.

ON hammer
SAY Maybe you find my hammer. I like it much better then these ones. I would [reward] you if you bring back my hammer.
ON reward
SAY Well, I would give you two normal hammers if you bring back mine. Just come back, have the hammer with you and [claim] the reward.

SECTION TRG 126
{
FMSG You need Lesley's hammer to claim the reward.
NEED xfb5
USEUP xfb5
IADD 98
IADD 98
EMT Many thanks for bringing my hammer! Here's your reward.
SND 00 42
SND 00 3d
MSG You receive two smith's hammers. Pick 'em up.
}

After you added these to the scripts you go with your GM and seek
out the NPC Lesley and use this commands on her.
'SETSPEECH 101
'CTRIG 126
'WTRIG claim

Now you need to set up an item spawner somewhere in a cave that
spawns the item 11040 every now and then.
Voila! Here you go with your first quest! ;-)


And now for the gory details.

speech.scp:
As you sure can see this one is altered only for the purpose of
explaining the quest to the player. I took the normal vendor
speech as blueprint and added some sections. I use the [keyword]
style cause its easy to understand. In this case the keyword
"claim" has no line in speech.scp cause it is handled in
ntrigrs.scp.
Attenetion: There are no linebreaks allowed in SAY lines
in speech.scp

items.scp:
I use this to create a "unique" named item. A problem is that
you *can't* check for item numbers from item.scp
(11040 in this case) in ntrigrs.scp!
You can only check for the HEX number from the .mul files!
That is why I choose "ID 0FB5". It is the graphic of a hammer
(I found it with inside-uo) but it is not the graphic that is
used when vendors sell hammers.

ntrigrs.scp:
First I set a message that the player sees when he does not
have the hammer in his backpack.
"FMSG You need Lesley's hammer to claim the reward."
Now I do a check that fails with this message or runs the
script further.
"NEED xfb5"
Then I "use up" the hammer to make it disappear.
"USEUP xfb5"
USEUP checks availability too, but exits the script with a
hardcoded message in case, that's why I do a NEED first.
ATTENTION: NEED and USEUP need the items HEX representation in
LOWERCASE and WITHOUT LEADING 0. I know this is different
from other scripts but in ntrigrs.scp things are this way.
Took me one hour to find out =P
"IADD 98"
"IADD 98"
Then I give two normal smith hammers as reward to the player.
Attention: "IADD 98 1" does not work! So, you can't add things
to the players pack!
"EMT Many thanks for bringing my hammer! Here's your reward."
EMT Makes a message appear as if spoken by the NPC.
"MSG You receive two smith's hammers. Pick 'em up."
Finally this is a message that appears as system message in the
lower left corner.

Double-Voila! =)
I guess now you know how to make a few quests that keep your
players busy untill we can use the full fledged engine.
How about having a "unique item" appear in the lootpack of a
monster? Or why not reward the player with some gold and another
"unique item" that must be used for another quest?

Have fun!
