<p><strong>This documentation exists only for the current implementation of townstones.  Much of this information will be invalidated at a later date</strong>
<p>Townstones will be released in 7 planned stages - Each known
as a "phase".
<p>The first phase is included in this release (68017 - Aug 26 1998).
<p>FEATURES!:
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Townstones are based on regions
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Multiple Townstones may be placed in one region, but
they all give
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; info about the same region.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Townstones are of two types (automatically determined)
based on the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information in regions.scp file.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Players may become a resident of a town, wilderness,
or none at all.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Residents of a town may freely leave residency to none.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * If a player is a resident of another town then the one
he/she wants
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to join, then they will automatically leave
the prior town upon
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their joining the new town.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Residents of a town (other then wilderness type) may
vote for mayor.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Residents of a town may vote however often they wish,
but votes are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not tallied until the 'election day'.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Residents of a town may opt to display the town they
are from on their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paperdoll.&nbsp; If they choose to display
their town title, their reputation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; title will not be shown (may be changed at
a future date).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * The elected Mayor is forced to display their town title
on their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paperdoll.&nbsp; It is in the format of "Mayor
&lt;playername> of &lt;townname>,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;skilllevel> &lt;skill>"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * The elected Mayor has "Mayor" prefixed to their displayname
from allnames.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * If a mayor leaves residency of the town for either none,
or another, then
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a new mayor is automatically detected based
on number of votes at that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Townstones display the current mayor on them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Townstones display the total population for that town.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Wilderness regions display 'unruled region' for mayor.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Wilderness regions display 'unknown' for population.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * To cast a vote for Mayor, the person whom the player
wants to vote for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; must be online, and preferably onscreen. (Target
based).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * If voting is 'mis-targeted' then the previous vote is
unchanged.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Residents may not vote for players who are not a resident
of their same
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; town.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * The player whom a person is currently voting for is
displayed on the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; townstone.
<p>FOR GMS!:
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; To add a townstone, follow this process:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * add a new item of type 0edd or 0ede (/add 0e dd)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * rename the item to 'Townstone for _____', as the default
name is not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appropriate.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * set the morey value to 0 (/setmorey 0)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * set the morez value to the current weekday number
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (/setmorez 0)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (/setmorez 1)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuesday:&nbsp;&nbsp; (/setmorez 2)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday: (/setmorez 3)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday:&nbsp; (/setmorez 4)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (/setmorez 5)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday:&nbsp; (/setmorez 6)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That's it! Your townstone is now setup!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Townstones are based on regions found in the regions.scp
file.&nbsp; If the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; NAME property of the region contains the word 'of' then
the region will
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; be considered a town, with the name being the text following
the word
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'of'.&nbsp; If it doesnt contain the word of, then it
is assumed to be a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; wilderness region.&nbsp; This means placing a townstone
inside of Lord British's
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Castle would be considered a wilderness stone.
