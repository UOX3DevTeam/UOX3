	    	    HTML Stream
		    <p>
		    The HTML Stream feature allows UOX to print an HTML file (You set the name and DIR) with the data you
		    specify.... Example, Say I'm running a UOX shard, and  run my webpage locally, and I want UOX to print
		    my shard's status, every, lets say, 30 secnods. I set HTML to 30 in server.scp and then script my web
		    page in htmlstrm.scp (See below) and every 30 seconds UOX will create this webpage as I have scripted it.
		    <p>
		    server.scp:
		    In SECTION SERVER add the line:
		    HTML #
		    somewhere.. where number is the Time IN SECONDS you want the page to update, 0 or -1 will disable
		    html streaming.
		    <p>
		    htmlstrm.scp:
		    *Note* All commands MUST have their own line. Commands Must be first thing on the line, everything
		    after the command will be ignored.(Exept for LINE)
		    <p>
		    SECTION ONLINE_PAGE<br>
		    {<br>
		    C:\UOX\index.html File name MUST be first. filename and dir should be the ONLY things on this line
		    <p>
		    LINE Put HTML tags, and ANYTHING here that you would like the page to show, in HTMl code, like images,
		    colors fonts etc.. Put as many as you want.
		    <p>
		    TIME -this command will rpint the current time in "hh:mm:ss AM/PM" format.
		    <p>
		    NOW -This command will get the NEXT online player's name, so If I make 10 of these commands, each 
		    command will show a player's name, only the first 10 names will be displayed, the others will be ignored.
		    <p>
		    NOWNUM -Number of people online
		    <p>
		    ACCOUNTNUM -Number of accounts on the server
		    <p>
		    CHARCOUNT -Number of characters on the server (Large shards may experience a LITTLe lag with 
		    this.. if you use NPC before this command, charcount will be cached, so if you use 
		    charcount, you might as well use NPCS, and viceversa)
		    <p>
		    NPCS -Number of NPCs on the server
		    <p>
		    ITEMCOUNT -Number of items on the server (Small lag on large servers)
		    <p>
		    UPTIME -Time the server has been up in hh:mm:ss format
		    <p>
		    IP # -IP of the server # is the number of the server in the ini (First entry is number 1 so put IP 1)
		    <p>
		    GMNUM -Number of GMs online.
		    <p>
		    CNSNUM -number of counselors online
		    <p>
		    PDUMP -Performance dump (<BR> after each line)
		    <p>
		    SIMCYC -Simulation cycles per second (Number only)
		    <p>
		    UDTIME -How often the page is updated (The number you scripted in server.scp (in minutes))
		    <p>
		    VER -Shows the server version and OS (ei "70.03.00 [WIN32]" or "70.03.00 [LINUX]")
		    <p>
		    BUILD -Shows the UOX Build number (eg: Build 15g)<br>
		    }
		    <p>
		    SECTION OFFLINE_PAGE<br>
		    {<br>
		    C:\UOX\index.html -- FILENAME FIRST!!!<br>
		    When the server is shut down, this page will be saved, commands avalible here are LINE, UPTIM, and TIME only.<br>
