		    <p>
		    The new house system works as Follows:
		    <p>
		    Everything is stored in house.scp there are 2 types of sections for this file:<br>
		    SECTION HOUSE # (This will be used in the deed's morex)<br>
		    {<br>
		    ID #### (Multi id# (From insideUO) take the number inside UO gives and add 40, so a small house is 0000068 this translates into ID 4068)<br>
		    SPACEX # ((optional)The RADIUS of clear space needed from the center of the house.)<br>
		    SPACEY # ((optional)Same as SPACEX only for the Y axis)<br>
		    CHARX # ((optional)Offset from the center of the house that the Person making the house will be	placed at when the house is built)<br>
		    CHARY # ((optional)Same as charX only for Y)<br>
		    CHARZ # ((optional)Same as charX only for Z)<br>
		    HOUSE_ITEM # (This refers to the other type of sections in house.scp for placing Misc items in the house, Up to 100 per house.)<br>
		    }
		    <p>
		    SECTION HOUSE ITEM # (For items place in and around the house)<br>
		    {<br>
		    ITEM # (Item # from items.scp)<br>
		    LOCK ((optional) makes the item's more=the key's more, so in effect makes that item lockable, mostly for signs, doors, and chests.)<br>
		    MOVEABLE ((optional)Default is that all items are not movebale, use this to make them moveable)<br>
		    DECAY ((optional)Make the item Decay)<br>
		    NODECAY ((optional) Default, make the item not decay)<br>
		    PACK ((optional) Makes the item appear in the player's backpack)<br>
		    X (Offset from the center of the house)<br>
		    Y (Same as X only for Y)<br>
		    Z (same as X only for Z)<br>
		    }
		    <p>
		    Set the deed's moreX to the SECTION HOUSE number and that house an all associated items will
		    be added. You can enter your house without unlocking the door if you have the key in your
		    MAIN pack. Just like OSI.... "You quickly unlock, use, then relock the door." Enjoy the new
		    housing system!
