		    Player Vendors
		    <p>
		    HARDCODED Player vendor NPC # is 2117, this
		    means whatever NPC is # 2117 will be added as a player vendor..
		    you could make an Orc or a daemon vendor, it'll work :-).
		    <p>
		    Say Vendor buy to the vendor and you will get a targeting cursor target what's you wanna
		    buy, and if you have enough money, it's yours. If you own the vendor, you can drag things
		    on and off the vendor, when you drop something in his pack (not ON him) You will be asked
		    to set the price, set it to 0 and the default from scripts will be used, you will then be
		    asked to set a description. To get the gold from you vendor, just say "vendor gold" and he
		    will tell you how much you have earned that day, how much he is keep as his pay (10%) and
		    how much is left for you. If he has made less than 10 gold, he keeps ALL of it. If he has
		    made more than 65535 gold, things get tricky. It *should* work out so if you make lets say,
		    80,000 gold, you should say vendor gold twice, the first time he will give you 65535, the
		    next time, he will give you whats remaining, but he will take his 10% out both times, so be
		    careful or he'll rip you off :-)
		    <p>
		    A player vendor deed can be ANY time with type 217.
