<p>Script Interested: Regions.scp

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>For every region you can add:                                 
<ul>
    <li>GOOD <num> (Num is setted into items.scp in every items.)    
    <li>BUYABLE <num> (Num range from -oo to +oo and is the % to     
      add or remove from item value. (1000=100.0% , 342=34.2%)   
      For example: if you have IRON ORE setted as GOOD 1 (sets   
       into items.scp) with VALUE=5 GP, and set here in region 3 
       (britain):<br>
       GOOD 1<br>
       BUYABLE -153<br>
       when you go into Britain and say VENDOR BUY you see the   
       IRON ORE as value 4...why???                              
       Simple: <br>BUYABLE=-153<br>
               -153 / 1000 =-0.153 (as -15.3% of original prize)<br>
               -0.153 x 5 (IRON ORE VALUE) = -0.765<br>
               5 (IRON ORE VALUE) - 0.756 = 4(.235)<br>
   <li>SELLABLE <num> (Num range from -oo to +oo and is the % to add or remove from item value. (1000=100.0% , 342=34.2%) This is the same as BUYABLE but take effect when you say VENDOR SELL.
   <li>RANDOMVALUE <num1> <num2> (Num range from -oo to +oo          
      every item will be setted on VALUERATE (Random from num1   
      to num2) and every VendorRestock each Item Value will be   
      modified based on valuerate). For Example:                 
      If you set IRON ORE as GOOD 1 with VALUE=10 and            
      RANDOMVALUE -100 100, its value changes every restock-time 
      ranging from 9 (-10.0%) to 11 (10.0%).                     
      This changes will be added afetr calculating SELLABLE and  
      BUYABLE andtake affect when you say VENDOR BUY or          
      VENDOR SELL.
