		    npc.scp:
		    <p>
		    add these commands to any npc
		    <p>
		    SPLIT ##<br>
		    SPLITCHANCE ##
		    <p>
		    where SPLIT is how many it can split into when hit
		    <p>
		    SPLIT 3
		    <p>
		    it has a posibility of spliting up to 3 extra npcs each time hit
		    <p>
		    and where SPLITCHANCE is the chance that an NPC has to split when hit
		    <p>
		    SPLITCHANCE 50
		    <p>
		    the npc has a 50 percent chace of splitting each time hit.

	    	    Gump System, inscribe.gmp
		    <p>
		    New Gump System: 
		    <p>
		    Read the inscribe.gmp file, it is well documented and should be easy to follow.  If you then go into
		    the UOX code you will see how i implemented it.  Now I did NOT write the new gump system, rather 
		    Kathrrack did, and I am very impressed by it.  Note that you now have to compile with the im.cpp,
		    im.h and fromuox.h files to get all this to work properly. 
		    <p>
		    Inscription: 
		    <p>
		    Ok guys, inscription as we all know it is now here, straight from UO 
		    itself.  It works like normal, click on inscribe skill, click on blank scroll (0e 34) select circle then
		    spell and poof, you now have a scroll of whatever.  Inscription currently checks the inscribe skill on a
		    sliding scale based on the spell you are inscribing.  This may need later tweaking if it is too easy to
		    do (or too hard for that matter) 
		    <p>
		    Engraving: 
		    <p>
		    This is new and non-UO, select inscribe skill and target a piece of armor.  It will then ask you for
		    circle and spell to engrave.  If successful, you will place the spell on the item with 5 charges on it. 
		    This checks the magery skill, the tinkering skill and the inscription skill, it is rather hard to master.
		    Again this may need tweaking later. A player may engrave any item that has att or def greater than zero,
		    thus shirts, armor, weapons, hats may all be engraved. Food and  pets may NOT.
