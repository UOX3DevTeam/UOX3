There is actually a directory structure now from versions 0.95.00 and above.  Noteably, this is not QUITE permanent, but it is almost 100% complete now, we're just trying to see where we are going to put the JS scripts.  But here it is, anyway.

Purposes of each directory
==========================
archives       -       Unchanged from previous versions.  Archiving (once fixed) will go in here
books          -       This contains all the books in the world
dfndata        -       This is the parent dir where the definition files will ultimately reside.  Currently, it is SCP based (and existing scripts should work).
                       Each subdirectory replaces an existing script.  The misc subdirectory is where you place your misc.scp, the npc directory is where you
                       place your npc.scp.  Note that trigger is likely to be deprecated (currently old triggers.scp do nothing).
help           -       Mostly unused at the moment.  Help files and other things will go here in future.  However, the commands subdirectory IS useful at the 
                       moment.  If you place a file in there with the name of ACCT.txt, for instance, if you use 'howto and select ACCT, the contents of that
                       file will be displayed along with other information.
html           -       Default output directory for html output.
images         -       Used with HTML as a default location for images
logs           -       Logs of all sorts will be here.  That includes server logs, packet logs, and error logs (though not all currently do).
player         -       Player HTML goes here, by default
scripts        -       Information that does not fit into the existing script system goes here.  Noteably the multilanguage dictionaries do, as well as
                       scpTrig.scp, envoke.scp and teleport.scp.
shared         -       World file location.  Note that there is a distributed world file system now, breaking the world down into smaller geometries.
                       A world converter IS being worked upon that will convert from this format to an old one, and vice versa.

Please note that old trigger system scripts will NOT work, nor will old speech.scp.  And as such, it is difficult to convert from old->new and new->old, as this information will NOT be preserved.
