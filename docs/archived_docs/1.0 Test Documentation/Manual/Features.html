<h1>Features</h1>
<p>UOX has many features, both from OSI shards and from peoples ideas. New
features are constantly being added, and old ones are being revised to work more
efficiently all the time. The main features of the current UOX release are
outlined briefly below.</p>
<h2>Definition Format Scripts:</h2>
<p>The scripts have been revised and added to in order to come up with the new
definition format. It provides more opportunity for customization when working
in conjunction with the new JavaScript engine.</p>
<h2>JavaScript Engine:</h2>
<p>Developed in conjunction with the new scripts, the JavaScript Engine that
powers the UOX world is definitely something to be reckoned with. Boasting a
huge array of events and functions, and backed by a dedicated script team, its
sure to make UOX an enjoyably interactive experience for you and your players.</p>
<h2>Stability:</h2>
<p>Many sections of UOX's base code have been painstakingly rewritten from
scratch, and its paid off. UOX can now handle a far larger player base and do it
with great stability.</p>
<h2>New Customizable User Interface:</h2>
<p>Along with the JavaScript engine and definitions has come a much more
navigable in-game user interface. This aids in quick and efficient shard
building, or managing in-game events and players problems. These menus can
easily be altered though the revised gump system and scripts, which also allows
simple creation of new gumps for any custom aspects of your shard.</p>
<h2>In-Game Features:</h2>
<p>With this release of UOX comes the most complete list of in-game features
from both OSI and player run Shards. They include:</p>
