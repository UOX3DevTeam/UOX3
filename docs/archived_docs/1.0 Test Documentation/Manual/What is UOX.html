<h1>What is UOX?</h1>
<p>UOX stands for Ultima Offline eXperiment.</p>
<p>It is a server emulator for OSI's Ultima Online Server, created by Marcus
Rating. UOX was one of the first, if not the very first server emulator for
Ultima Online. This server emulator enables you to create your own server and
play on it either locally, over modem, LAN or the internet. Currently, with the
right system and connection, it is possible to hold upwards of <u>XXX</u>
hundred people.</p>
<p>There is no fee to set up an UOX server, and there is no fee to play on one.
UOX is now approaching the final release, and its future looks bright indeed. It
currently has many of the features you will find on OSI's servers (see
features), and everyday more new and exciting ideas are becoming part of UOX.</p>
<p>Even though Marcus Rating was the original creator of UOX, he chose to
release the code for the server emulator and make it open source (see below).
Now a dedicated development team is now working together to further enhance the
emulator and a dedicated script team helps implement new features and irons out
bugs in existing scripts. A continually expanding free-lancer community is also
contributing more than ever to UOX's development.</p>
<p>However, one thing that came with the release of the code, was the GNU
license agreement. It states that no one can modify UOX, without releasing the
modifications to the public. In other words, UOX is freeware and you are welcome
to work on it, as long as you then release any changes you have made to UOX.</p>
