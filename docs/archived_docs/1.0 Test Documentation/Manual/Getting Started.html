<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>In order to get your Shard running, you need to setup two seperate files.
These are uox3.ini and accounts.adm. Both are explained in detail below.</p>
<h2>Setting up uox3.ini: </h2>
<p>Open the uox3.ini in your UOX folder. Here you will need to set up any Shard
entries you wish to setup, world entry points (which only need to be changed if
you are using a custom world) and the paths for your .mul data files. Below is
the default uox3.ini:</p>
<p>Your shard name<br>
Your IP address (local, network or internet)<br>
Your port-address (usually 2593)<br>

<h3>Shard Entries:</h3>
<p>To setup Shard entries, you will need to find the IP of your network or
internet adapter, or use 127.0.0.1 for a same machine entry client. Shard
entries consist of three lines, a name, an IP address to connect to/through and
a port. Shard entries can be given any name, but the IP address and port must be
a valid UOX server.</p>
<p><b>Note: It is possible to have several shard entries set up in your UOX3.cfg
file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These entries must have
the correct IP for people entering via that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shard on the Shard choice
screen. Example, is you have a network<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; address people connect
on, a internet address people connect on and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; server administrator
playing on the same system the server is on, then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you will need three shard
entries set up with the different addresses as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shown below (from
UOX3.cfg):</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UOX3 World
(Internet Clients only)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 256.351.2.9<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2593<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UOX3 World (Network
Clients only)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.168.0.6<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2593<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UOX3 World (Local Host
only)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 127.0.0.1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2593</b></p>
<h3>World Entry Points:</h3>
<p>If you are using a custom world map (ie, a completely different world from
OSI's, or one created in Green Acres), you may need to change the world entry
points for new players. Each of the named entries corresponds to the towns on
the &quot;town entry&quot; screen that players are presented with as the last
choice of character creation. These value are XYZ coordinates and can be found
in-game by using the <b>'where</b> command&nbsp; while using a player with gm
privileges (normally any player on account 0)
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These values can be changed at any time without affecting any other
components of the Shard. This concludes the setup of uox3.ini.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ACCOUNTS.ADM) Open the ACCOUNTS.ADM file found in the UOX folder.At the top
you will see&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION ACCOUNT 0,in here you will put the Username and
Password of the Char who will have the GM stats. The first account allways has
GM priv`s. Here is an Example of what the ACCOUNTS.ADM file should look like:</p>
<p><br>
SECTION ACCOUNT<br>
{<br>
NAME adminaccountname<br>
PASS adminpassword<br>
LOCK 0<br>
LOCK 0<br>
LOCK 0<br>

SECTION ACCOUNT<br>

PASS player1password<br>
LOCK 0<br>

TIMEBAN 0<br>

}<br>
<br>
<br>
EOF
<p>You can use any name that you want in there. And you can add as many accounts
as you see fit. Just add them exactly as the first two accounts are setup. And
remember the two empty lines before the EOF at the END of the accounts file, no
matter how many accounts you have.<br>
Also note that the first account in the list is reserved for the&nbsp; server
operator and has some special privileges, like having GM rights on every fresh
created character.
<p>2) Set up your Network: (If needed) To play UOX3 you will need at least one
IP adress assigned to your machine. This is required because of a client bug
which will crash the client after playing the intro movie if there are no IP
adresses available. Because its in the Client, we can not do anything about it.
You can either:
<p>a) Connect to your ISP which automatically assigns an IP to you, then press
START and RUN and write in &quot;winipcfg&quot;. Now you should see your
internet IP in the window that pops up. Another way to see it is to do /dns <MYNICK>
 (without the &lt; &gt;) while on a IRC server.
<p>b) Set yourself a static IP adress. Go to the Win95 control panel and then
select Network Settings. Then single click on the TCP/IP entry in the enabled
network componets box, then click the properties button. Now click the radio
button labeled &quot;specify an IP address&quot;. Now, you are able to fill in
the two boxes below it. In the first one, the IP address box, you need to enter
an IP address of your choice. (&quot;1.1.1.1&quot; works, but any other number
will do.) Then, set the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0. Click &quot;OK&quot; and
windows will ask you to restart your computer, click &quot;OK&quot;
<p>*IMPORTANT* Remember, you need to re-enable the upper radio button before you
can connect to your ISP the next time.
<p>c) Type &quot;ping localhost&quot; on the command line of an open ms-dos
prompt window. First line should be like: &quot;Pinging zeus [127.0.0.1] with 32
bytes of data:&quot; The name before the [127.0.0.1] will be different, as it is
your computers name. Now edit the file named &quot;hosts&quot; in your windows
directory and add a line like &quot;127.0.0.1 zeus&quot; below the one that
reads &quot;127.0.0.1 localhost&quot;. Again, remember to replace &quot;zeus&quot;&nbsp;
with your computers name. Once you reboot Windows, the client should work
without crashing.
<p>If you are on a LAN, you probably already have a permanent IP adress&nbsp;
assigned to your network card and can skip this step. Also remember that if you
choose possibility b) or c) people from the internet can&nbsp; not connect to
your server. Choose a) if you want multiplayer.
<p>3) Setup the program:&nbsp; Copy your login.cfg to login.old as a
backup.&nbsp; Unzip all UOX files into one directory.
<p>4) Run the server:&nbsp; Run UOX3.EXE&nbsp; If all's fine, it will print
&quot;UOX3: Startup complete.&quot; on the console.
<p>5) Change login information:&nbsp; Now edit your LOGIN.CFG (you backed it up,
didn't you?) to the shown&nbsp; IP adress. So if it were the one displayed under
3), your LOGIN.CFG&nbsp; would read:
<p>;Loginservers for Ultima Online<br>
;Do not edit this file or patching will fail!&nbsp; Always save a backup.<br>
LoginServer=1.2.3.4,2593<br>
LoginServer=1.2.3.4,2593<br>
LoginServer=1.2.3.4,2593<br>
LoginServer=1.2.3.4,2593
<p>Use IP 127.0.0.1 for a single player game by yourself and for a multi-player
game,You will need to setup your internet IP address. You will also need to give
that IP adress to everyone trying to log&nbsp; in to your system. (A good
program to keep contact to your friends for that purpose is called ICQ. You can
download it at&nbsp; www.mirabilis.com) When editing login.cfg, don't forget the
port number. In the above example, 2593 is the port.
<p>6) Start Ignition which you'll find in a subfolder of uox. It will start the
UO client and bypass the encryption so you can log into your UOX3 shard. The
current Ignition version will only work with UO Clients 2.0.0 -&gt; 2.0.0e.</p>
