<h1>Connecting to a Shard</h1>
<p>In order to connect to a player run shard, your players must have both the
latest version of Ignition and a OSI client patched to at least version 2.0.0 or
alternatively they can use UOGateway and the latest OSI client. Using UOGateway
requires more setup by the server administrator, but is much easier to use in
the long run especially if you have created custom .mul files. If you have
created custom .mul files and decided not to use UOGateway, you will need to
provide these to your players through your website, an ftp, or other means. Once
the players have obtained the .mul files, they should backup their original .mul
files and replace them with the new ones.</p>
<h2>If you are using Ignition:</h2>
<p>Before starting ignition, ensure that your login.cfg in the OSI client
directory contains the IP address of the UOX server you wish to connect to in an
uncommented line. A commented line is represented by a semicolon (;) at the
start of the line.</p>
<p><b>If you are connecting from the same system that the UOX server is running
on, then the IP address should always be 127.1.0.5 (see example below).</b></p>
<p><b>If you are connecting from another system on the same network as the
server or via a modem/internet connection, then you will need to place the IP
address of the UOX server you are connecting to in an uncommented line in your
login.cfg.</b></p>
<p><b>Ensure that there is only ever one uncommented line in your login.cfg!</b></p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample login.cfg:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;Loginservers for Ultima Online<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;Do not edit this file or patching will
fail! Always save a backup.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LoginServer=127.0.0.1,2593<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;LoginServer=24.69.214.181,2593<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;LoginServer=216.59.106.234,2593<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;LoginServer=lucitania.dns2go.com,2593<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;LoginServer=208.63.177.199,2593<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;LoginServer=24.51.69.195,2593</p>
<p>The example above allows players to connect to several shards by just
changing which lines are commented and which one isn't. Providing a login.cfg on
your site for players would be a prudent choice.</p>
<p>Once login.cfg is setup and any .mul files that need to be replaced have
been, then it is a simple matter of running ignition.exe, entering a username
and password and then selecting which Shard entry and character the player
wishes to use.</p>
