<h1>System Requirements</h1>
<p>While there are no set system requirements for UOX, shown below is the most
basic system that would be advisable for use as a standalone UOX server running
no programs other than those required by the system and the UOX server.</p>
<h2>Basic system:</h2>
<p>Pentium 1 @ 100 MHz<br>
32 Megabyte of RAM<br>
1 Gigabyte HDD, with at least 25% of that amount free<br>
Windows (95 and up) or Linux<br>
Network or Internet connection</p>
<p>While it is possible to run both UOX and the OSI client on the one machine,
this is highly discouraged. The system detailed above would have very little
chance of running both the server and a client without severe system latency. If
you must run both programs on the one machine then you should make copies of the
.mul files UOX uses and place them in a subdirectory in the main UOX directory.
Be sure to set the path to the copied files in your UOX3.ini so that UOX can use
them.</p>
<h2>System Components:</h2>
<p>Also note that the individual components of a system affect UOX in different
ways. Below each of the main components of a system are detailed how they affect
UOX.</p>
<h2>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</h2>
<p>The CPU has only a middle range effect on UOX's performance. CPU speed deals
with how many operations UOX can get done in a certain amount of time. If UOX is
running alone on a server the CPU would rarely need to be more than&nbsp;
Pentium 2 @ 233 MHz.</p>
<p>UOX does not support multi-threading at this point in time, and there are
currently no plans to support it in the future.</p>
<h2>RAM (Random Access Memory):</h2>
<p>Memory is the most important component in any server, and this is no
different with UOX. The more memory the server has, the more players, items and
other objects it can hold. Memory also limits the amount of scripts that can be
efficiently run, so if you have an extremely detailed world with many
interactive events, you will need a large amount of RAM. The bare minimum amount
of RAM you should run UOX with is 32 Megabytes. For optimum performance 128
Megabyte and over is recommended.</p>
<p>The type of RAM you have does not matter, but better results may be achieved
from using higher bandwidth RAM such as SD-RAM or RD-RAM.</p>
<h2>HDD (Hard Disk Drive):</h2>
<p>Hard drives have very little effect on UOX's performance, so there is no need
to run out and buy a 18000 RPM hard drive because it might improve UOX's
performance. However, a fast hard drive will assist in server saves and
archiving operations. Hard drive space is a much more important factor in a UOX
server, so buy space, stability and reliability before speed.</p>
<h2>Operating System:</h2>
<p>UOX currently supports both Linux and Windows (95 and up), with different
code builds supporting both operating systems. Operating systems are a personal
choice, but Windows 2000 is the preferred choice for its stability and
flexibility if you intend to run programs other than UOX on the same system.</p>
<h2>Internet/Network connections:</h2>
<p>These connections give UOX the bandwidth to handle clients. Obviously the
better the connection, the more clients and less latency the server will have.</p>
<h2>Video and Sound cards:</h2>
<p>Both video and sound cards have no affect on UOX's performance whatsoever.
Unless you use the server for other more graphically or audible demanding
programs, than don't bother with anything other than the basic.</p>
<h2>Everything Else:</h2>
<p>Pretty much everything else in a system has a negligible effect on UOX, and
therefore isn't important if you are running a server just for UOX.</p>
