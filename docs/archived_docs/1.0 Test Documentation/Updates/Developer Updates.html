<h1>Developer Updates</h1>
<h2>10th April, 2001 (Build 24a)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Beneficial spells (Heal, Night Sight, Agility, Cunning, Cure, Protection,
    Strength, Bless, Greater Heal, Inivisibility ) on murderers will flag you
    criminal
  <li>Races constructor/destructor modified to not cause crashes
  <li>Fixed inability to repeatedly cast magic
  <li>Fixed cannot use items equipped on other players bug
  <li>Shitlist read in as a vector at startup, and run through in memory on
    login
  <li>F key on console will reload the shitlist.ini file
  <li>Cannot hide while mounted
  <li>Attempting to resurrect a murderer via bandages results in criminality
  <li>Attempting to cure a murderer via bandages results in criminality
  <li>Attempting to heal a murderer via bandages results in criminality
  <li>If you don't have the skill to heal a character, it tells you that you
    apply the bandages but it barely helps. Their health only goes up by 1 HP.
  <li>If somehow on horse while stealthing, will go out of stealth when
    attempting to walk
  <li>Few pathfinding corrections (fleeing NPCs work better)
  <li>Slight change to teleport, may fix black liche thing
  <li>Stack being refreshed when items added to it
  <li>If hidden when mounting a horse, become unhidden
  <li>When mounting, creature attacking the mount will stop attacking. Mount
    will lose any target they may have.
  <li>Slight changes to readw3(), to prevent overruns.
  <li>Explicit NULLing of files when closed.
  <li>Races added a new tag, to help streamline scripts. PARENTRACE # where # is
    the parent race. This essentially is just a cut/paste job
</ul>
<pre>ie
SECTION RACE 0 // Just happens to be the parent
{
NAME Human
STRCAP 150
DEXCAP 30
INTCAP 120
PLAYERRACE 1
}

SECTION RACE 1
{
PARENTRACE 0	// by using this, they automatically get strcap of 150, dexcap of 30, and intcap of 120, as well as being a player race with the name Human
NAME Midget	// we override the name given to us
DEXCAP 60	// increase the dexterity cap
}

In essence, you can picture race 1 being like:

SECTION RACE 1
{
NAME Human
STRCAP 150
DEXCAP 30
INTCAP 120
PLAYERRACE 1
NAME Midget
DEXCAP 60
}</pre>
<p>This allows you to streamline races, if you need to. You can extend this to
grandchildren, or grand grandchildren, if so desired. If you have a group of
classes belonging to a race, then all the common aspects of those classes could
be put in a parent race, and specialize in the child race.</p>
