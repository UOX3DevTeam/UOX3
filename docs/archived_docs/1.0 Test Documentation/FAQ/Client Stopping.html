<h1>Why does my client stop at &quot;Verifying&quot; or &quot;Connecting&quot; ?</h1>
<p>There might be several reasons for this. Here are some of the things that may
cause these problems:</p>
<h2>When halting at Verifying Account:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You have put the UOX port (2593) behind your IP address instead of on the
    line below in UOX3.INI. Remove the Port address from UOX3.INI
  <li>You are using the wrong UO Client, or the wrong UOX version. Download the
    latest versions of both programs.
  <li>You are not using Ignition or UOGateway to start the UO client.
  <li>The client has crashed.</li>
  <li>The server may be restarting or booting up.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When halting at &quot;Connecting&quot;:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You haven't put the UOX port (2593) behind your IP address in LOGIN.CFG.
    Add the port to LOGIN.CFG, so it says &quot;LoginServer=ip.address,2593&quot;
    (where ip.address is your IP address )
  <li>You have put the wrong IP in either LOGIN.CFG or UOX3.INI. Make sure you
    have the same IP address in both of these files, and also make sure the IP
    address is valid. Most computers use 127.0.0.1 as the local IP address, or
    &quot;loopback IP&quot;. Use this if you want to play offline, locally on
    your the same computer as UOX is running on.<br>
    Else, use WINIPCFG (open run, then type in &quot;winipcfg&quot; and press
    enter) to find your LAN/Internet IP if you intend to use either of those.
  <li>The Client or the UOX3 server is behind a Firewall which is not set up to
    let the connections through.
  <li>The client has crashed.</li>
  <li>The server may be restarting or booting up.</li>
</ul>
