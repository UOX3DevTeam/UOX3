<h1>How can I make dragons rideable?</h1>
<p>You cannot.</p>
<p>The only solution that has been really realized so far is replacing the horse
graphics with modified dragon sprites on every users client.</p>
<p>All other ideas about players being able to ride different creatures are only
theoretic, and are doubted if they will ever be possible. Even if it could
function, it is a general agreement that the system would be very ineffective
and lag prone. Also, from what is known of the client it would probably look
terribly wrong in all action animations.</p>
<p>Rumors are around that OSI themselves already wanted to make them rideable
and failed.</p>
