<a name="what"><h3>What is Ignition?</h3></a>
Ignition is a run-time memory "patcher".  It modifies the UO client software in
memory at run time.  You can read more about it and get updates from the Ignition
site at:  <a href="http://www.beosil.com/ignition/">www.beosil.com/ignition </a>.</P>

<a name="why"><h3>Why do I need Ignition?</h3></a>
By default UO uses an encrypted protocol, and this encrpytion changes also from time to time.</P>

Before ignition UOX always had to know and understand the latest encryption,
which forced to have all users to have the same client version and it also took
long development cycles until the latest encryption was hacked.</p>

UOX no longer bothers itself with encrpytion, instead a tool
(ignition) modifies your client in memory, so it sends all data to the server
unencrypted.</p>

Modifing it in memory allows you to play on UOX shards
without destroying your ability to also play on OSI shards.</p>

To be able to correctly modify the client, ignition has to know how a
particular client.exe version is constructed. This info is stored in the ignition.cfg file, that's the reason you always need a new version of this file whenever OSI
patches their client. (at times have to wait some days until someone disambles the client, evaluating the new adresses needed to &quot;patch&quot; your client)</p>

An up-to-date Ignition.cfg file can usually be found in the uox CVS tree <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/uox3/uox3_new/ignition.cfg">HERE</a>.</p>
<a name="need"><h3>Do I need to use Ignition?</h3></a>
Yes, and no. </p>
Yes, because you must not have any encryption in your packets to the UOX3 server.</p>
No, because there are some other programs that may do what Ignition does, which should
be fine.  But, the UOX3 team uses Ignition right now, so that's what is recommended.</p>
<a name="linux"><h3>Is there an Ignition for the Linux client?</h3></a>
Sorry, nothing that we know of.  If you find something let me know!  I'm a Linux
user myself.</p>
