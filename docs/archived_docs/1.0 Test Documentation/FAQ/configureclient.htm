<H1>Getting your client working</H1>
<HR>

<H2>Install Your Client Software</H2>Install your client software as you
normally would. Then start it up as though you were going to play on one of the
official shards. This will innitiate the patch process. If all goes well, you
should have the latest version on your disk drive when all is done.
<P></P>There is not need to have an active account with Origin, or to log in to
their servers.
<P></P>
<H2>Install Ignition</H2>You should be able to get the latest Ignition package
from:
<P></P><A href="http://www.beosil.com/ignition/download.html">Ignition - UO
Package Page</A>
<P></P>Open the zip of the latest UO package for Ignition into a directory of
it's own. If you have third dawn, open up ignition.cfg in notepad, and look for
these lines:
<P></P><PRE>#!file "uotd.exe"
#!registry "Software\Origin Worlds Online\Ultima Online Third Dawn\1.0" "ExePath" ""
</PRE>
<P></P>What you want to do now is remove the # from those lines, so that
ignition can find your 3rd dawn client.
<P></P>If for some reason ignition does not have a patch for the version of
client.exe you have, follow these directions:</P)
href="ftp://ftp.owo.com/pub/uo/client/" <a at it point and client FTP an up
Start>ftp://ftp.owo.com/pub/uo/client/ </A>Look for a directory with an
appropriate client revision. You'll see a directory (most likely) named 3-0-2g,
that'll be your normal T2A client. You'll see a directory (most likely) named
3D_Build68, that'll be UOTD. Head into that directory. Backup your current
client.exe (same files found in the directory you've chosen) Download file into
your UO client directory.
<P></P>The version of client.exe should be displayed on your initial startup
screen.
<P></P>
<H2>Preparing the client</H2>
<P>Preparing the client is a fairly easy task to do. if you're running the
server on the same machine as your installed client head into your UO client
directory, you'll see a file called login.cfg and it'll look much like this:</P><PRE>;Loginservers for Ultima Online
;Do not edit this file or patching will fail! Always save a backup.
LoginServer=login.owo.com,7775
LoginServer=login.owo.com,7775
LoginServer=login.owo.com,7776
LoginServer=login.owo.com,7776
</PRE>
<P>If you're client is on the same machine as your server, then change login.cfg
to look like this:</P><PRE>;Loginservers for Ultima Online
;Do not edit this file or patching will fail! Always save a backup.
;LoginServer=login.owo.com,7775
;LoginServer=login.owo.com,7775
;LoginServer=login.owo.com,7776
;LoginServer=login.owo.com,7776
LoginServer=127.0.0.1,2593
</PRE>
<P>Notice that there is now a ; in front of the previous login server entries.
This comments it out so that it doesn't try logging into UO and instead logs
into your shard. If you want to log into an official UO shard again, you just
need to uncomment (remove the ;) the login.owo.com lines and comment out your
line (by adding a ; in front of it).</P>If your UOX3 server is on a different
machine than your client, you need to replace the <I>127.0.0.1</I> with it's LAN
IP address. This may be your internet IP (if it's connected to the net) or your
LAN IP (if it's on a personal LAN). For example, if your server is on a LAN at
ip <I>192.169.0.1</I>. You'll need to change it to look like:
<P></P><PRE>;Loginservers for Ultima Online
;Do not edit this file or patching will fail! Always save a backup.
;LoginServer=login.owo.com,7775
;LoginServer=login.owo.com,7775
;LoginServer=login.owo.com,7776
;LoginServer=login.owo.com,7776
LoginServer=192.168.0.1,2593
</PRE>
<H2>Starting to play</H2>Once the Ignition software is installed and configured,
you must start your UO client with Ignition to play on the UOX3 shard. Do not
start it with the normal menu icons. Just execute Ignition and, if you've
installed and configured it correctly, Ignition will take care of starting up
your client.
