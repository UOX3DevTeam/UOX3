<h1>How do I create a playable Orc race?</h1>
<p>All kinds of races (Orc, Daemon, Dragon, Dog, Cat) are possible, but any
graphic other than the male, female or gm players will make your paper doll
blank. You will have to guess where items (swords, clothes, Armour, etc) are. Items
also won't show up on your character in game. If you still wish to make other
races, heres how:
<p>First make a gate to change the player:</p>
<p>'ADDITEM 2523</p>
<p>Now set it to a monster gate:</p>
<p>'SETTYPE 82</p>
<p>Now set it to the type of monster you want:
<p>'setmorex #&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(where # is the npc number in npc.scp, for example, an Orc would be 69)</p>
<p>Have the player walk through the gate and its done.</p>
