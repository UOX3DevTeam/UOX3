<h1>What can be done to stop decorations from causing lots of lag?</h1>
<p>Well, fortunately, there is a program which was designed for situations like
this. It goes by the name of Worldforge, and is available from http://blah.blah.blah/blah.
Worldforge serves two functions that help solve this problem:
<h4>1. Freezing:</h4>
<p>This function allows you to add your decorations to your statics0.mul by
&quot;freezing&quot; them. This would make your new decorations and buildings
static items, so not only is your lag cut down, your can also use circle of
transparency on them. Freezing will save type, position, and hue, but any other
values will be lost. Therefore you cant use this on items that need to be
triggered.
<p>To freeze an item, just set its type to 255 ('settype 255) in Ultima Online
and then hit the freeze button in Worldforge.</p>
<h4>2. Melting:</h4>
<p>This function allows you to &quot;unfreeze&quot; 8x8 blocks of items that you
have previously frozen, in order to delete them or edit them. You can then
&quot;refreeze&quot; those items once you are done editing.
<p>To melt a block of items, find the coordinates in Ultima Online by using the
where command ('where) and then divide both x and y coordinates by 8. Put these
coordinates into the corresponding Worldforge boxes and then hit melt. To
refreeze the items, just hit the freeze button in Worldforge.</p>
