<h1>Why doesn't lumberjacking work on my shard?</h1>
<p>Lumberjacking does work, but it will not &quot;work&quot; for players if they
have circle of transparency in the UO client enabled. If they do have it on, the
client is attempting to target the ground behind the tree instead of the tree
itself.</p>
<p>And one also needs to target the TRUNK of the tree, not the leaves.</p>
