<h1>Is UOX legal?</h1>
<h2>Developing for UOX:</h2>
<p>Is perfectly legal! UOX is a independent piece of software that does not
violate any laws.</p>
<h2>Distributing UOX:</h2>
<p>Is perfectly legal as long as you also include the source and license
agreement.</p>
<h2>Running a UOX server:</h2>
<p>Is mostly legal. UOX relies on the .mul files from your UO-client, however
these are only <b>COPY</b> protected as the name says, not <b>READ</b>
protected. Thus an application only reading them is legal.</p>
<h2>Creating a completely new map (with .mul files):</h2>
<p>Is legal.</p>
<h2>Creating a modified map (with .mul files):</h2>
<p>Is illegal! Your map files (ie map0.mul, statics.mul) are copy protected by
OSI. Thus you may not modify them. However completely replacing them is allowed.</p>
<h2>Connecting to an UOX server:</h2>
<p>Is legal if you have an older client (pre T2A).</p>
<p>However, the T2A and all more recent versions have an additional paragraph in
the installation license agreement, (which you had to accept to continue) saying
that you will not provide or use any means other than OSI through which UO can
played. Meaning, if you connect to an UOX server you are invalidating your
client license. Unfortunately the consequences of a violation of an installation
license are unkown (other than invalidating this license).</p>
<p>However, with this issue they can only catch the people they want to keep,
THEIR PAYING USERS! Technically, OSI could easily track people who are connected
to UO emulators, as the client does keep logs. </p>
<h2>Providing older client.exe's for your shard:</h2>
<p>Is illegal! This clearly hurts OSI copyrights, even if you put up a
disclaimer for experimental, or any other purposes.
<h2>Playing with new .mul files:</h2>
<p>Is legal, but will be considered cheating by OSI if you login to one of their
Shards with the new files.</p>
