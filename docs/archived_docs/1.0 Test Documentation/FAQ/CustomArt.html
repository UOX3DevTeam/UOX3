<h1>How do I add custom art work and animations?</h1>
<p>There are a few programs out there that can in fact edit art work and
animations but you can't create anything new.
<p>You will have to write over the old artwork, and animations are hard to make
because there has to be...
<ul>
  <li>walking in every direction animation
  <li>attacking animation
  <li>death animation
  <li>spellcasting animation
  <li>etc...
</ul>
<p>And its hard to find any room for all that. Plus you have to be pretty good
at doing the animations.
<p>A slight update:
<p>There's room for NEW artwork(items) without having to overwrite any old one.
There are a lot of places where OSI seem to have skipped item numbers, going
from say 20ff to 2200 (wild example, not sure if it's valid).
<p>But it's worse with animation, yes.
<p>One program you can use to add new artwork/gumps is Punt's Mulview
program...you'll find it on the Other Utils page.
