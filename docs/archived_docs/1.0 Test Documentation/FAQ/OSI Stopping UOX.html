<h1>What has OSI done to stop UOX?</h1>
<p>Almost nothing.
<p>In fact, it would appear that they don't care too much, as we are all only
small fishes compared to their user base. It is quite possible that the combined
total of all player run Shards is less than that of a single OSI run Shard.</p>
<p>The only thing that they may have done is changing the encryption roughly
every 6 months. However, it is suspected that this is more to keep people from
cheating than to stop emulators, which has been proven by the use of programs
such as Ignition (which cracks the clients encryption).
<p>There are rumors that say that OSI did call for lawyers as soon some player
run Shards started to charge money, and they did interfere when player run
Shards started distributing the OSI client.exe.
