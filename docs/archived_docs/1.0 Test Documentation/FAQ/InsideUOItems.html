<h1>How do I add items from InsideUO?</h1>
<p>The proper form to add anything is...
<p>'add ID ID
<p>Yet the items in insideuo have somthing simular to this 0000 (0x0000)
<p>Well its easy, the ID ID is the 4 numbers or letters after the x (0x1256)
would be 'add 12 56
<p>If there is only 3 its the same (0x123)
<p>'add 1 23
