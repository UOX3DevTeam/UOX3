<h1>Are the user supplied FAQs, guides and tutorials checked to see if they are
correct?</h1>
<p>No, they are not normally checked by anyone other than the person (or people)
that created the files.</p>
<p>If they are on a well trafficked site then they may be checked by users who
know a fair bit about UOX and will make sure any corrections that are needed are
made.</p>
