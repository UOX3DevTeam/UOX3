      <font size="2">As it currently stands, UOX3 publicly is generally in a 
      feature freeze. We are not turning our back to features, but we are aiming 
      at priorities to bug fixes. If people DO want to add features into the 
      public regular builds, then we ask them to, in advance, try and run a 
      design doc by us, so that we can either nix it or green light it early on. 
      But our definite primary focus is on bug fixes and it will stay that way 
      for the foreseeable future</font></tr>

      <font size="2">It'll be ready when it's ready. At the moment, there are 
      subsystem integration issues we still need to overcome, but that is one of 
      the few things holding us back now. Very soon now we'll be heading into 
      intensive shard level testing, and there will be opportunities to play 
      with the new system through that. Also, if anyone has scripts they want 
      tested, then they can send it to me. I believe that Jester|Copplepot is 
      working on a script repository of all sorts, and that JS snippets will end 
      up going into that. The Script Team (Seph and co) are also in the provess 
      of converting the triggers that already exist into JS based scripts, and 
      they should be available once they are done as well. Isn't that right Seph?</font></tr>

      <td colspan="2"><a name="3">With build 24b and the inclusion of the port 
      line in uox3.ini are we going to be able to set the port UOX runs on now, 
      or will it server the same purpose as the PORT line in server.scp? 
      (Rembrant, 1)</a><tr>
      <td valign="top" width="5%"><b><font size="2">Abaddon</font></b><td>
      <font size="2">People often misunderstand the purpose of the uox3.ini file 
      the server.scp setting is to dictate on which port the current server will 
      run. The entries in the uox3.ini are different. These are very much 
      loginserver type entries. Many of the entries that are in this file are 
      used purely to relay. You could setup an OSI style loginserver, with 
      different physical servers, based from this. Thus, the port entry was 
      required in the uox3.ini to allow relaying to different ports. For 
      instance, it now allows, if you have a heavy powerful machine, to run 
      multiple shards (via multiple instances) on the same machine, each running 
      on different ports, and all coming up on the same list. One of the other 
      changes of 24b was to force the port setting in server.scp to be loaded 
      before networking, so it is ensured to work correctly</font></tr>

      <td valign="top" width="5%"><b><font size="2">Abaddon</font></b><td>
      <font size="2">I don't really see the hardware requirements changing all 
      that much. More RAM will be useful, as the JS engine takes about an 8MB 
      chunk of RAM I believe. Hard disk speeds don't need to be as fast now, as 
      we do a better job of caching files and scripts. CPU speed won't change 
      all that much. Sure, there are more things in memory, and it does more via 
      the JS engine, but it gets around the interpretive nature of the existing 
      triggers and speech files. </font></tr>

      <td valign="top" width="5%"><b><font size="2">Abaddon</font></b><td>
      Ultimately, I'd say that RAM might be slightly up, though there are other 
      conservation mean. HD remains fairly unchanged, as does CPU. Hopefully 
      network bandwidth requirements will be less (they seem to be)</tr>

      <td valign="top" width="5%"><b><font size="2">Abaddon</font></b><td>
      <font size="2">In my outlook, I try and be as realistic as I possibly can. 
      I cannot force people to think of it in any particular way, but I do try 
      my best to keep people real, and down to earth. However, you do have to 
      remember that it IS a significant step forward over triggers, and with 
      good scripting and good ideas, you will be able to achieve a whole lot. 
      Some people will always be disappointed, even if it was flawless and did 
      everything perfectly. That's human nature, people always want more ;) But 
      if there any holes in the system, then it is time that people come forward 
      with suggestions. I've taken many suggestions for functions and events for 
      the system, which has helped it get up to rev 0.19 of the docs. People can 
      readily contact me, emailing me at dsstratton@hotmail.com or abaddon@uox3.net 
      (finally got that one fixed again). Contact information is in the FAQ, 
      which is both online and offline (CHM based). </font></tr>

      <td valign="top" width="5%"><b><font size="2">Abaddon</font></b><td>
      <font size="2">I can't really say yes. I know that EviL has plans on a 3D 
      client, but never has the time to work on it I believe. I've tinkered 
      around with DX8 and 3Dness, and have almost managed to make a decent 3D 
      map viewer. Having said that, I'm going to rewrite the bulk of the 
      renderer I think, as I've come up with a neat new way to get better hills 
      I think ;) But that can be freely got from me any time, though it doesn't 
      do all that much currently. But if a UOX client was to be written, I think 
      it would have less constraints than the OSI system would have, and would 
      (hopefully) require less overall resources than the OSI one </font></tr>

      <font size="2">Yes ;) Tanis was working with EviLDeD on a new version of 
      xGM. Command changes will be made available, as well as script layout, 
      fairly soon to help with 3rd party developers. I believe that EviLDeD is 
      going to be talking to some parties to work on account tools. And we hope 
      to combine some of the uses of the JS engine with tools, allowing JS to be 
      remotely submitted and executed (as a part of xGM). </font></tr>

      <font size="2">The only extra download you should need, as a user, would 
      be a DLL that goes in your uox3 directory. Nothing more should be required 
      than this DLL. For developers, it would be a different matter. To manually 
      build the JS engine (or even the source for that matter, as it requires JS 
      engine headers) requires a download of 700 files or so, or around 12MB 
      worth of source I believe. But that will also be provided. Might even be 
      able to provide a precompiled header/libraries for it. In reality, a lot 
      of that 12MB isn't necessary. Just the headers and developed libraries 
      would be&nbsp; </font></tr>

      <font size="2">It depends on the shard op ;) If your shard op is 
      cluttered, then certainly it won't help. But there won't be any fixed 
      requirement to have all your JS scripts in one place, for instance. You 
      can happily make subdirectories, and categorize them that way. Even 
      filenames are entirely up to you. </font></tr>

      <font size="2">Well, that's more a 3rd party thing than anything... I

      <font size="2">It's an interesting idea, but I don't think anyone's 
      described how such a system could be achieved. It would require careful 
      balancing of network loads and bandwidth. Remember, the bandwidth 
      associated with a network card is much much lower than that of a CPU's 
      memory subsystem. So all fetches out over a network would be an order of 
      magnitude slower than memory. I imagine it would be possible, but no one's 
      sat down and down the concept work associated with it </font></tr>

      <td valign="top" width="5%"><b><font size="2">Zane</font></b><td>
      <font size="2">Might I add something? Remember, OSI shards aren't entirely 
      cohesive, over server boundaries. And they don't really work together, 
      more so different areas are run by different servers. While this is 
      possible when you know the exact system and specs you are working with. It

      <font size="2">It's undergoing it at the same time. The JS engine is only 
      part of the systems affected. Networking has been rewritten to a large 
      degree, accounts have been heavily modified, grossly accelerating login 
      process. Create menus are undergoing changes, races and weather have 
      received hefty updates, memory and speed optimizations have occurred, file 
      caching has been improved, code has been tidied up/documented and clutter 
      removed. This is one of the reasons that the JS engine release hasn't
