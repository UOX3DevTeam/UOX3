<H1>16th UOX3 House of Commons Chat</H1>
<H4>17th June, 2001</H4></CENTER>
<P class=question><B>zazy\tele</B>: hum, well, please ask him oder they, whtas 
different between osi and uox3... is it just a clone, so i feel like playing on 
osi, or is there any special thing?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: Well, first of all UOX is open source</P>
<P class=answer><B>Cobol_Junky</B>: UOX3 is a emulator, you may call it a clone 
however it is not. It is its own server software that you can run ultima online 
on, and how you run it or what you want to run on it is up to the admin. If you 
want special items\quests etc.. its all possable With the use of some tools 
designed for UOX3, you can also create whole new worlds, art and some more 
awsome stuff. With UOX3 1.0 you will be seeing more features that make it easier 
for the user to make a in-depth shard.</P>
<P class=question><B>BaZ</B>: Will there be a new GM tool made diectly for UOX 
other than shard ace and World Builder?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Xuri</B>: That's basicly up to the users :) ShardAce was made 
by a user, WB was made by a user.. :P</P>
<P class=answer><B>Cobol_Junky</B>: UOX is a open source project, unlike other 
emu's. Creating tools for it is much easier and theres plenty of support in the 
community that might be willing to help you. There is already LOTS of good 
tools.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: With the new scriptengine it is very easy to 
program a GM tool to use directly from within the client. So maybe that will be 
one way =)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Cobol_Junky</B>: There is no specific people that are allowed 
to make tools, we will post them on uoxdev by anyone :)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Sephiroth</B>: I also believe there is still xgm support in 
(and being added on) UOX3.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: Yes, definately.</P>
<P class=question><B>Calin</B>: Is there plans to support ishandar or khaldun 
areas in uox?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Sephiroth</B>: Ishandar requires new packets, and from 
hearing from Ripper\LB lots of code. I don't see why it wouldn't be worked on in 
the future though. Khaldun can be done by one person that can script 
npcs\triggers and that can decorate it. I would do it myself if I had the info 
for it</P>
<P class=answer><B>Cobol_Junky</B>: Also note that with tools like dragon and 
worldforge, you can create your OWN dungeons, map, area for people to try with 
uox3.</P>
<P class=question><B>sardiax</B>: Are there any plans to create a reward 
system?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: Yes there definately are, but they will be with 
the new JScript engine and unlikely in code, so it will be easy to modify them 
to your hearts content. With the new system we will hopefully have many of such 
systems, like bounty hunting, witch- or treasure hunting etc. but to be honest, 
they arent prio 1 on the list =)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Sephiroth</B>: treasure hunting also requires some 
cartography packets that no one has recorded yet.</P>
<P class=question><B>zazy\tele</B>: Is this jscript-system hard to understand? 
(example code would be nice)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: Well I find it very easy to understand, and there 
will be lots of example code coming with the distribution. Plus, we are starting 
an extensive script library at uox3.sourceforge.net. So everyone is welcom to 
browse and send in =)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Cobol_Junky</B>: *peep* UOXDev.com is also going to have a 
php database of everything you can think of, from scripts to code to 
worldbuilder templates to patches.</P>
<P class=question><B>Vaelfar</B>: Are further developments in uox3 likely to be 
based on hardcode or scripted material in the future?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Vaelfar, as far as future developments go, only 
core supportive changes will happen in hard code, we would actually like to do 
most of the extensions to UOX3 through scripts, wherever we possibly can</P>
<P class=question><B>BaZ</B>: In the new build will any extra downloads by the 
user be required?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: No, there should be absolutely no need for 
clients to change at all. There might be only one or two extra downloads 
required for the server, but they'll be minimal. As far as the clients are 
concerned, all updates should be transparent. And as one of the things that is 
being worked upon, v1.0 should actually come with an installer as well (so no 
more having to figure out what to put where)</P>
<P class=question><B>laocourn</B>: What is the current status of UOX? Can we 
expect a release this week? Next week? Next month?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Well, obviously at the moment you can't see the 
ToDo tracking stuff with regards to 1.0, but you can see bug / fixture 
requests</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: We have approx 45 ToDo on code and approx 20 ToDo 
on scripts</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: I'm hoping, as a niceness to all here that 
showed up, to allow you all to enter the beta testing that we have been running 
here (if you so desire), so in that regard you'll be able to get a hold of a 1.0 
release this week. I do have one or two things I'd like to finish up in regards 
to useability (ie world file converter) to make it easier, so there will be a 
more public 1.0 beta test this week.</P>
<P class=question><B>BaZ</B>: Will the new system be more stable Client and 
server side?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: We can but hope. Already it's actually looking 
promising. Sure, there are problems still, none will deny that, but stability 
has really come along in the last few weeks. And on top of that, there should be 
much less problems when it comes to bugs in world files and containers and what 
not, a lot of the niggly issues should have disappeared.</P>
<P class=question><B>BaZ</B>: Will the new system give us more control over 
combat?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Yes, it certainly will. Amongst other things, 
Chaos is going through and doing a rewrite of that system now, so he's your man 
to talk to if you have anything special you want put in. But on top of that, a 
number of the events (swinging, attack and defense) will be overrideable by the 
JS engine, so you can write custom combat routines for special characters, if 
you so desire.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Cobol_Junky</B>: Also, inconsistency in scripts should be 
fixed somewhat with the new system. Correct abaddon?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: That is definitely correct. Most recently, I 
have been able to implement multiple file scanning for entries (under Windows). 
So rather than have whopping great big items.scp and what have you, you can 
break it out. Have your individual items in items.scp, your item lists in 
another script, and so on. And on top of that, you can have all your customized 
versions separate from the official package, thus allowing you to update the 
official scripts with no impact on your customized ones. </P>
<P class=question><B>zindryr</B>: ahhh...ok: Are there any plans to make the aea 
where container information is held variable? For instance right now as I 
understand the container information is held in X0 to X200, would there be any 
way to make this changeable?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Yes, there certainly is. The systems have 
changed enough that I'm actually removing those restrictions, so that the entire 
world is available for shard ops / players to use. No more odd requirements to 
fit a certain geometry.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Sephiroth</B>: to follow up to splitting up of items.scp, the 
definitions files are now about 40-50 different files containing the same stuff 
that items.scp and npcs.scp used to contain.</P>
<P class=question><B>casanova</B>: Any news about evilded, and what happens to 
his work- threading the code?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: We're actually not entirely sure where EviLDeD 
is, I heard only a squeek from him a little while ago, saying he had 
difficulties and that he wouldn't be able to get online, so we're not entirely 
sure what's happening, but we do hope he is well. </P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: As far as the threading of the code goes, I do 
have the ideas he was playing out with me. I have NO experience threading code, 
so I'm taking my best shot at it. Currently, there are 2/3 threads, and I know 
he wanted to do more, so I'm going to try and implement them.</P>
<P class=question><B>BaZ</B>: Are all the old scripts being rewriten, NPCs, 
ITEMS, Spells, etc</P>
<P class=answer><B>Sephiroth</B>: Yeshe and I have been on this task for quite 
some time, and I'm pleased to say a vast majority is done.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: Even cooking is completely new =)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Sephiroth</B>: Npc's is split up, but I still need to 
balance\tweak it. 95% of items are done. I'm working on 
npclists\itemlists\lootlists\any kind of list you can think of at the moment. 
</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: Im atm in the process of converting all triggers 
to the new system, so we can switch over completely.</P>
<P class=answer><B>* Xuri just wants to point out that he wrote one of the new 
.dfn files ;)</B></P>
<P class=answer><B>Sephiroth</B>: yes Xuri is the weapons man ;0</P>
<P class=question><B>Cobol_Junky</B>: What are some of the small nick nack 
features that will be in 1.0 that we might notice different from the current 
builds?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Well, there's quite a few little nifty features 
now available. For one, we've gone and used gumps a lot more, where we can. The 
add menu gump is now much simpler, allowing single button press, not requiring 
checking a field and hitting a button. Also, things like 'cstats now present as 
gumps not as streams of text. Scriptable ore/ingots is now a possibility, and 
we're working on multiple skill/resource dependencies for create.scp</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: A 1.0 status page (outlining new features and 
the state) is being worked upon, so that people can see what's the go with 
it</P>
<P class=answer><B>* Yeshe lets ppl know that create.scp is 90% done too 
</B></P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: And the appearance of those gumps (background 
image and text colour, button styles) is also customizable by the shard op. And 
for all you regions fanatics, light cycling now appears on a region basis, not 
global, and you have scriptable dungeon regions ;)</P>
<P class=question><B>Dreoth</B>: How will NPC AI improve with the release of 
1.0?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Well, hopefully, it will be improved by the 
shard ops, though I believe Orcberg is working on some standard AI packages. As 
one of the features of the JS engine, it's entirely possible for you to script 
new AI types, so as not to be dependent on code.</P>
<P class=question><B>Mr_Fixit</B>: Question: How will the magic system work in 
the new scriptsystem?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: The magic system has been greatly worked upon. 
In fact, for the majority of the spells, we've been able to unify NPC/PC/Item 
magic into a single system. Thus, NPCs will have ~40 spells or so that they can 
cast in combat. On top of that, you can cast spells from the JS scripts, and 
they will be useable for NPCs.</P>
<P class=question><B>SuperGenius</B>: Is AI multithreaded?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Unsure yet, the JS engine is thread safe though, 
and we're trying to put the AI there, rather than in the server</P>
<P class=question><B>Jeruvy</B>: Will the 1.0 allow quickset up scripts to 
automatically set up the server?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Not entirely sure what you're asking here, but I 
am trying to get some configuration utilities that will allow you to setup the 
most basic stuff (servers, ports, paths, things like that, server.scp/uox3.ini 
stuff)</P>
<P class=question><B>Sir_fawnpug</B>: Will ore colors be defined in the new 
scripts?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Yes</P>
<P class=question><B>Yeshe</B>: Will 1.0 be available for Linux boxes?</P>
<P class=question><B>* Yeshe grins</B></P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: There are some known problems with Linux, and I 
know where they reside. However, I do not have the knowledge on how to fix it. 
So there should be a version available, but perhaps not with all the features 
(unless I find someone who can fix it :))</P>
<P class=answer><B>* Cobol_Junky points to certain people who are linux 
allstars</B></P>
<P class=question><B>Mr_Fixit</B>: Question: Will 1.0 have protection against 
Godclient speed hack?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: I've been given the code, and I'll be merging it 
in fairly soonish</P>
<P class=question><B>Dreoth</B>: Will shard admins have more control over the 
privileges of GMs, Counslors and players?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Well, there is already extensive control based 
on what commands they can execute. There will be the option to script further 
levels, so you can make super GMs, and other sorts of things (greater use of the 
command level stuff) </P>
<P class=question><B>Cobol_Junky</B>: Whats some of the stuff thats still 
hardcoded in 1.0.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Obviously we can't script EVERYTHING, but we're 
trying. The default behaviour of almost all skills will still be there, but it 
will be possible to override their behaviour. Wholist/offlist obviously, as well 
as the add menu. Magic system (on first pass, at least) will be hard coded, 
though in future I hope to allow JS overriding of each spell. The command table 
is still hard coded for the moment, but I want to do much the same there</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Walking will also be hard coded, and as a first 
pass, so will town region stuff (townstones overhaul).</P>
<P class=question><B>casanova</B>: Who will be responsible for any js engine 
related things after 1.0 is released? Including bugfixing and additions (if any 
are planned) ?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Well, as it stands, I've written the majority of 
it, so I guess it kinda would be me :) I've been asking for additions for months 
though, and they've really dropped off (I no longer get any). So bug fixing / 
extending it, most likely me (until I finish with UOX3, of course)</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: will it be easyer then previous Builds 
to create your own spells?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Eventually, with the JS spell overriding, but 
perhaps not first pass. However, you can override the onUse event of many 
objects ot allow custom spellish stuff (say, override a staff's onUse), and do 
sparkles and damage and pop up targets and all that jazz ;)</P>
<P class=question><B>Cyberspud|oops</B>: Question - Will the scipt allow ore 
'veins'?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Not... really. It's customizable down to a 
region basis. And there still is a limit, at the moment, of 255 regions (though 
that may be expanded, not sure). So if you made really small regions, then I 
guess you could say yes ;)</P>
<P class=question><B>Cobol_Junky</B>: Is there any change with accounts? Can be 
only allow 1 character per account? Can we add ban people into the sh*tlist from 
in-game?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Yes, there is definite changes. As it was EviL's 
subsystem, not mine, I haven't really tinkered much with it. Initially, it will 
remove the 2k account restriction, and provide significant speed ups when 
logging in</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: The functionality is planned, but not 
implemented yet (will be) to allow restricted number of characters per account, 
and the ability to ban people to the shitlist from in game</P>
<P class=question><B>Jeruvy</B>: How many players/monsters will the new server 
be able to handle in a event/scenario ten's, hundreds?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Well, we don't do file access anywhere near as 
much as we used to (better caching), and the JS scripts are compiled as compared 
to constant string parsing of the old trigger system. Memory requirements on 
players/monsters/items have dropped, so it would definitely be more than you're 
used to, but I haven't done any significant stress testing at all.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: You can attach a single JS script to multiple 
chars/items without a memory hit, as only one copy will be kept in memory.</P>
<P class=answer><B>* Cobol_Junky says would you say that if the computer was 
fast enough it might be able to handle over 500? (if the computer can handle 
it)??? </B></P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: depends on how close they are together, but I 
would hope so, yes Cobol ;)</P>
<P class=question><B>BaZ</B>: Will there be more smaller bug fixes out before 
the big release?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: I know it's been a while, and I do have some 
fixed source lying around, fixing a few bugs, blocking a few things, so if I 
don't think there'll be a reasonable public showing of 1.0 in the next few days, 
I'll do a release.</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Is it possible to get a copy of the weapons file 
for Version 1.0 early so i can create new Unique magic items?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: Well thats for me I guess. All scripts and DFNs 
are posted in the CVS at uox3.sourceforge.net. You dont need a CVS client to 
download the scripts and DFNs, you can browse them from the website. we are 
still adding things so stuff may still change a bit =)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Sephiroth</B>: Also, you don't need our weapons file to 
create magic items. You can link your own files through a sort of definition 
index file. I take that back, same functionality, different implementation. It 
takes all dfn's from one directory.</P>
<P class=answer><B>* Sephiroth bows ;0</B></P>
<P class=question><B>Dreoth</B>: If town regions stuff is hard coded, will shard 
admins have to recompile the source to use a new map with new towns?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Not quite what I meant. The behaviour of town 
regions (townstones, guards, light cycling, things like that) is hard coded, 
their location is NOT. No source code adjustments need to be made for different 
regions, only if you want to change the way they behave.</P>
<P class=question><B>Cyberspud|oops</B>: Question - How about stabling in v1.0 
:)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Funny you should ask that, it should definitely 
be possible, with some of the architectural changes we've made. It's not done 
yet, but should be a fairly simple change.</P>
<P class=question><B>Sir_fawnpug</B>: Will there be more support for UO TD as 
far as compatibility with things such as add menus are concerned?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: I've been more worried about getting other 
things done (like Unicode). We've been doing extensive work on 
translation/customization of outputted messages, but I believe that the add menu 
issue with gumps has been resolved by the new add menu system.</P>
<P class=question><B>Vaelfar</B>: Chaos, this isn't really an HoC question... 
but how are you compiling the information for the UOX3 scripts?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: Well, my part is mostly done via stratics, and I 
have an active account on OSI to check out things. For example i did all 
create-menus that way. We try to stay as close as possible to OSI values for the 
release to give people something they know and can start off easily from.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Sephiroth</B>: Anything in default uox3 scripts that has info 
out, has been taken from uo.stratics.com (or an active uo account).</P>
<P class=answer><B>Xuri</B>: (Or just completely random if no other info is 
available) ;)</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: Will it be possible to setup that say 
Oak make better Tables then Cedar or Merkite makes better chainmail then 
Iron?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: I can think of one relatively easy way, and that 
is control it's creation through a JS script. Once you make it, you can examine 
what was used to make it, and boost it's stats accordingly.</P>
<P class=answer><B>* Cobol_Junky thinks of a easier way</B></P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: Well it wont be in the release as far as I see it 
but yeah, it will be pretty easy to make an addon in script. But, please define 
"better table" hehehe j/k</P>
<P class=answer><B>Sephiroth</B>: sell value of course ;)</P>
<P class=question><B>Sir_fawnpug</B>: Will hue cycling be an option for dyed 
entries?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: What's hue cycling when it's at home? Never 
heard of it ;)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: Well with a time it could be done with JScript</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: timer, sorry</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: I've just been informed it might be cycling of 
it's colour given time... *ponders*... yeah, it might be possible, provided you 
setup a repeating timer from when it was created, and on each timer iteration, 
adjust it.</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: If we wanted to make a server based on 
an RPG like AD&amp;D; is it possible to get an EXP system put in instead of Rep 
System? and can we make class' that can only take certain skills, etc?</P>
<P class=answer><B>* Cobol_Junky ponders with slight coding\commenting out, and 
script engine it might be pretty easy</B></P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Well, doing an EXP system wouldn't be all that 
simple, that would still require code changes I believe (that, or until we get 
this packet handler stuff nailed via JS :)). There is already ways to completely 
bias races against a particular skill. It won't stop them using it, but it can 
make them effiectively suck (ie always negative skills)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: As far as AD&amp;Dish features go, there is the 
ability to use dice rolls via the JS engine (check the ROllDice function), and 
as you can change combat fairly substantially with it... it's already starting 
to be there for you.</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Will Necromancy be put in, and work 100% 
including possibillity of its own spell book?</P>
<P class=answer><B>* Yeshe has just killed all the old necromancy triggers 
...</B></P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Well, we're trying not to stuff in a whole raft 
of features people don't want. In reality, I see this coming in under JS 
enhancements, myself ;)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: if you would like this, script ahoy! ;)</P>
<P class=question><B>Cobol_Junky</B>: What will be the new system requirements 
to hold a shard of 20 people with the new 1.0 release?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Less demanding than the old ones ;)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: memory utilization should be down, bandwidth 
requirements should be a little less</P>
<P class=answer><B>* Cobol_Junky throws away ram\cable modem, and buys 56k to 
keep up with 1.0 technology</B></P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: I don't think I'd have any probs running it, 
with a P3 500 128 MB RAM, on a cable connection (provided the connection is 
decent). Could swing it with less, definitely, if you don't use the client on 
the same machine ;)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: but some have tested with about 8 people or so 
running 1.0 on a 56k, without too much lag</P>
<P class=question><B>Question</B>: Speaking of spellbooks, have you found an 
alternative to use for people who want to make there own custom spells and have 
a book to put them in?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Oh, from a conceptual perspective, it's fairly 
easy. Create yourself a new book, and when it's used, pop up a custom gump. When 
something's dropped on it, set the right notation to determine what spells you 
have (either by a) using old style system and putting the scroll in the book, as 
a container, or by b) new style system, setting a bit to determine it's 
presence). Almost all of what I said with the custom spellbook SHOULD be 
possible (once the gump funcs are written) to do from entirely within the JS 
engine.</P>
<P class=question><B>Cobol_Junky</B>: Abaddon do you know what 1.0 up 
stream\down is for every user? (pertaining to last question)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Cobol_Junky: It's been a while since I did any 
major testing on it, to tell you the truth, but it is possible to log all the 
packets coming from/going to a particular socket.</P>
<P class=question><B>Cyberspud|oops</B>: Question - Will Runebooks be easily 
done with the new script?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: I'd see it as less of a challenge than the 
customized spellbook. Same old pretty book, just using recall runes (so you'd 
have the book as a container).</P>
<P class=question><B>Sir_fawnpug</B>: Will there be individual script files for 
skills, so, for example, we can do things like use inscription to mark certain 
objects or extend what you can do with skills?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Well, if you're refering to skills.scp, then you 
could split that out into multiple files, if you so desire. If you mean skill 
BEHAVIOUR, then no, you'd have to put them all in a single JS script file (and 
note that, at the moment, only the blue button actions are scriptable for skill 
use, but we're working on it).</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: If we as players and shard runners 
create stuff like the EXP system, and make it fully optional will it get put 
into official releases?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: If it's fully optional, I see nothing against 
it, no</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: We have an own section for it at uox3 and a 
searchable databse on uosdev =)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: uoxdev sorry.</P>
<P class=question><B>Cyberspud|oops</B>: Question - I heard that Townstones were 
'getting some lovin'...will these be functional in v1.0?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Perhaps not to full extent, but yes. Features 
that already exist are voting, mayor support, changeable taxes/tax resource, 
budget viewing (of previous mayor), purchaseable guards, and townstone 
damage/theft</P>
<P class=answer><B>Cobol_Junky</B>: *that sounds like a treat and a half*</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: what about fully new weapon types like 
(for example from the 3rd Edition AD&amp;D book) an Orcish Double Axe or a 
Dwarven Urgrosh. would you put new weapons into the scripts and make them 
optional NPC's that sell them?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Well, with the ability to put things into 
separate packages, that's actually a lot easier ;)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: you could make the entire thing your own 
package, which doesn't modify a user's own scripts, or the official scripts, and 
have them readily available for use</P>
<P class=answer><B>Chaos</B>: The wonderful thing about the JS Script engine is 
everything you do isnt done by overwriting other's work, and is easy to pass 
around</P>
<P class=answer><B>Sephiroth</B>: same with the definitions</P>
<P class=answer><B>Chaos</B>: So you dont have to worry about other people's 
items and npcs overwriting your existing stuff.</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: as to what Cyberspud asked about 
townstones, does that mean players can use then to make thier own towns? or make 
it possible to use them to do that? and could u use that to buy NPC's for thier 
towns to sell thinks like blacksmiths?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Dropping a townstone into a region will turn 
that region into a town. All the functionality I thus mentioned should be active 
for that town</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: I do intend (given time) to allow merchant 
purchasing and other things (with upkeep costs)</P>
<P class=question><B>Sir_fawnpug</B>: Is it possible to implement checks?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: To be honest, there's no reason you can't do it 
now. But it would probably be easier under the new system, yes</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: As to being able to make or modify AI, 
would it be possible to make merchants travel specific roads like saying go from 
this point to this point, then go this one to that one, etc. to make trade 
routes?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: We've been looking into extending the abilities 
of NPCs. At the moment, it will be possible to get NPCs to pathfind to 
particular locations (with user controllable paths). I don't advise extremely 
long paths, as that would take time. And there is more changes I would like to 
make, to allow it to be easier, but yes, I thinki it should be possible</P>
<P class=question><B>Cyberspud|oops</B>: Question - How about having groups of 
NPC's pop up in given locations ala Orc camps or Brigands?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: We're looking to extend the spawning system to 
spawn multiple creatures at once, yes.</P>
<P class=question><B>Sir_fawnpug</B>: With the new scripts, will NPCs be able to 
follow schedules like in AUOX?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: As I've not played with AUOX, I can't really 
tell you. But it is possible to get the current hour, minute and day of the 
server, and if you use that in the onAISliver event, i see no reason why 
not.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: Sir_fawnpug, yes it will definately be possible. 
You can set the NPC AI according to daytime, to make e.g. vendors close their 
shops at night.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Sephiroth</B>: however, realize advanced AI on a semi large 
spell will eat up resources</P>
<P class=answer><B>Chaos</B>: A good amount of resources =)</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: will boats work better?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: There are only a few remaining issues that I 
know of, and they're being worked on, yes</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: would it be possible to Make you lye 
down on beeds?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Can you lie down anywhere? I don't thnk so, you 
could do the action on to the bed, but I doubt you'd stay there.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: Hmmmm</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: I have an idea on that one</P>
<P class=answer><B>Yeshe</B>: But definately not prio 1</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: Is it possible to like pay 5 gp for an 
inn and stay over night, make it so you can not play the char for 2 hours or 
somthin?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: There's no control yet over how long the logout 
time is for the script enigne, but it's somethiing that can be looked into, I 
suppose</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: is it possible to make the Silver and 
copper accepted as payment and well as sell things for silver and Copper?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: That type of a system is being looked into, but 
isn't near completion </P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: you could always just allow vendors to buy 
copper or silver though </P>
<P class=question><B>Question</B>: Many house of commons ago there was talk of 
uox3 developers action figures. I've had mine on pre-order now for a long time, 
where are they?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Xuri</B>: Several figures, amongst others Abaddon - will be 
available in a few weeks. Note that clothes and other items come seperate.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Cobol_Junky</B>: Street Prices are around $99</P>
<P class=answer><B>NOTE: The answer to above question was meant as a 
joke.</B></P>
<P class=question><B>Sir_fawnpug</B>: Will there be a feature that might allow 
player vendors to buy items being sold (according to a list or container, for 
instance)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: I haven't delved too deeply into it, but I can't 
see why it wouldn't be possible</P>
<P class=question><B>Cyberspud|oops</B>: Question - I have to ask...how about 
the line of sight issues?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: I have come up with a 4 pass LOS algorithm that 
may or may not be better (I think it might be), as the current line of sight 
algorithm has definite issues (hard coded item IDs, no accounting for height of 
an object, and so on)</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: So if I can get that implemented, I'll be 
testing it out and it should help, but I haven't implemented it yet</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: is it possible to make Anti-Magic 
area's where spells can not be casted, stopping ppl from recalling in out or too 
certain places?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: We've not done that yet, but I've actually been 
looking into it, as I was asked about that for current public builds for multis. 
As you know, aggressive spells are bad, but I'll see what I can do</P>
<P class=answer><B>Sephiroth</B>: also note there is a region.scp (unless it was 
removed?) that disallows recall\mark\gate in specific regions</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: correct</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: is it possible to give weapons AI? 
like make Rune Weps that think themselves, Like a staff that will only attack 
red ppl?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Those possibilities don't quite.. work.. yet. I 
am in the process of trying to extend the speech system though, so that items 
can respond to speech</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: is it possible, or how soon roughly 
could we get a copy of UOX 1.0 to test things we may want to add into it?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: Okey dokey folks, here's how we've (about bloody 
time) finally decided to work it, I believe</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: You can all happily subscribe to the testing 
mailing list. To do so, head to http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/uox3</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: From there, go to the mailing lists</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: and subscribe to uox3-testing</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: In about 2 or 3 days, after we've nailed a few 
bugs, we'll be doing another testing build update</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: This build update should fix some of the bugs we 
have, and clean up some of the tasks. On top of that, I'm hoping to have a world 
converter with it as well.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: So if you subscribe to that mailing list, then 
in a few days when we post to it, you'll be able to get your hands on a copy of 
1.0 test builds</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: we'll be making extensive use of the feature/bug 
tracking capabilities of source forge, so if you do test, and have bugs, please 
submit them through the bug tracker on sourceforge for the group</P>
<P class=question><B>Cyberspud|oops</B>: Question - What about keeping track of 
things per user...to implement a 'power hour' of sorts, or to allow custom 
titles based on the types of monsters killed?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: We've not been too keen on power hour type 
stuff, really, a lot of people we talk to say it ruined OSI to a large 
extent</P>
<P class=question><B>kirre</B>: Question: how would Race's work? would it be 
possible that if you go to an Elf NPC to buy somthing when your a Dwarf that 
they will sell it for like 50% more?</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: How do they work now? The same way. There's no 
current price change based on niceness / different race (Though enemy races will 
have the vendor scream for the guards, I believe)</P>
<P class=question><B>Question</B>: Is the memory problem with races resolved, it 
used to much ram with to many races before</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: There is a lesser memory requirement on races 
than there used to be, yes.</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: But even still, it would have taken many hundres 
of races before you started to hit an appreciable fraction of memory</P>
<P class=answer><B>Abaddon</B>: 1000 races would not even have been 2MB, I 
believe</P>
<P class=question><B>Abaddon</B>: and I think, with that, we'll close the HoC 
for today. It's been very long, and if the interest is there, we'll run another 
next week</P>
<P class=question><B>Abaddon</B>: Thank you all for coming, and asking so many 
questions, it's good to see such support</P>
<P class=question><B>Abaddon</B>: see you all another time! </P></BODY></HTML>
