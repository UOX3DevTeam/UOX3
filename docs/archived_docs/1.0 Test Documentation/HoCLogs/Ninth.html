    <td>Well, first and foremost amongst the new fixes will be a fix for the
      &quot;It begins to rain&quot; problem. I know a number of you find it
      incredibly annoying, and at the moment it's only quickly suppressed.
      However, a full fix is forthcoming, so rejoice, lag will get better :&gt;
  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon

    <td>What we envision at the moment, for a first initial (but not complete)
      implementation is an event based system
  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon
    <td>So you can write a script for an item/char for when they're attacked, or
      when they use a skill, or any number of events (around 25 or so at the
      moment)
  <tr>

    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Unseen

      detailed, a lot easier to manage, and have a lot more info

      person stepped on an item

  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Xuri
    <td>Basically it's this: All code goes through EviLDeD or Abaddon. So if you
      have some code you feel would gain the UOX3 community to have in UOX3, you
      send the code to them.

  <tr>

    <td>Well, we'd all love new skills, I know, but first and foremost we need
      to finish up the skills that already exist
  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon
    <td>Also, I don't think most people realize what new skills would require.
      It would require updates to the clients file, a modification to one
      particular packet (rendering any unmodified clients useless), and a few
      other niggling things
