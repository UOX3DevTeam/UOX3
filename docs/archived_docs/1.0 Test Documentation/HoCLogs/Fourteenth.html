      will be minimized.

      week, and computers were stolen. I have a semi-recent backup of what he
      was working on, but there was a distinct code loss that needs to be redone

    <td>I actually thought there was an option in our guild implementation to
      have alliances. With a quick scan of the code, it looks like there isn't.
      Real pity that, actually. However, guilds haven't always been a high
      feature request (or at least I get no requests about it), so that's
      probably why it's slipped through for so long

      it into the primary build, you should still be able to achieve it with
      scripts and customized gumps

      they're coming along quite nicely on the DEF files.

  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon
    <td>It really does depend. I'd advise no, because learning to code on this
      project, whether pre or post big build, is a good thing. If you learn to
      code on the current system, you'll see some of it's limitations, and see
      why we changed things
  <tr>

    <td>It's useful for a before and after situation. If you worry that you'll
      find code duplicated, or systems different, then it's highly likely. We've
      been spending a lot of time on cleaning things up and changing certain
      internals. You're likely to have fixed something we might already have
      fixed

      are deemed critical, but aren't all that simple. So... it really does
