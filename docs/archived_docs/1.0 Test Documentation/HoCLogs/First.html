<p>첚viLDeD: 첕oris: Will adding own pictures and sounds ever be
implemented? possibly after freeze devs try to make a UOX client?<br>
첚viLDeD: When things come together with the devs this year we will start our
journey into designing a uoxdev client to be used with the UO EMU's out there.
Not sure how long it will take, but proves to be a very exciting venture to
undertake. I would like to start dropping features, and gold, but I am going to
have to just say be patient, and see what the future hold..<br>
첚viLDeD: As for the Secure trade bug I am not up to speed on that
specifically at this time, maybe one of the other devs might be able to pop in
here. Otherwise it has been noted and will be looked into</p>

첮evana: that's from Boris<br>
첮evana: There is two groups working on necromancy currently..<br>
첚agle: also let me make a small note here is you have any bug that are
100000000% sure that its a script bug e-mail it to me and I will be sure to get
it fixed... ( eagle@uoxdev.com )<br>
* Revana glares at Eagle<br>
첮evana: I don't know which one will go in, both are different in how they
work. But I guess it will be the public's opinion<br>
첚agle: =) I am working on the new scripted spells....other than that I
believe rev is working on the hard code<br>

<p>첶uri: &lt;Boris&gt; if there was a woodchuck in UOX... how much wood
would that woodchuck if it could chuck wood?<br>
첶uri: a woodchuck would chuck no amount of wood cause a woodchuck can't
chuck wood. Even if a woodchuck COULD chuck wood, and even if a woodchuck WOULD
chuck wood, SHOULD a woodchuck chuck wood?<br>
* Revana laughs<br>
첮ain-: they don't chuck wood I hear ;)<br>
첚viLDeD: I was just going to say that the amount of wood that the wood chuck
could chuck wood was purely indicative as to how large his tail was, and the
size of his keyboard. so in short if uox3 could chuck would it would start a
fire :)<br>
첮evana: I really wouldn't care, just pull your sword and bash the wood
chucker.</p>

<p>첔baddon: &lt;Badmoon&gt; The source for the new build is being released
tonight right?<br>
첔baddon: Any changes we make to source always go straight into the CVS which
is a publicly viewable area<br>
첔baddon: we also keep devupdate.txt up to date every time we commit, so
people know what happened<br>
첔baddon: Xuri is working on an update.txt so people know what happened from
the 69 series to the 70 series<br>
첚agle: FYI : if you want to look at the cvs go to http://www.uoxdev.com/fur/<br>
쳎unt: A note to Linux Users out there. The compiler with RedHat 6.X will not
compile UOX source properly. Update to gcc 2.95.2 (the shipping version).</p>
