      that Gunther is unable to code for us, and Thyme is very busy, so I'm
      going to have to spend a fair bit of time bug fixing, rather than adding

      told they're rather useful. I'm not sure exactly on how they are
      implemented on OSI, but I'll have a look at it when I get the chance, and

  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon
    <td>Well, it depends on what particular aspect you're talking about. NPCs
      have to be intelligent to a degree, and the server generally does all the
      calculations for them (who they attack, where they walk, things like
      that). So it takes a fair degree of CPU time, which a PC would not do.
  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon
    <td>However, a PC takes a fair amount of network bandwidth, which NPCs don't
      impact on at all. So the more PCs you have, the faster the connection
      you'll need

      intelligent NPC that logs in like a PC would :&gt;

    <td>A side note that I've learned from my experiences, don't set the
      NPCSPEED settings in server.scp too low, you will experience serious lag,
      and the NPCs move a little too fast, best setting I've seen is 0.6
