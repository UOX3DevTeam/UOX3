  <li><a href="#81">W00t 1st question on the q-bot! When can we expect another
    build? (Laocourn, 1 votes)</a>
  <li><a href="#82">With the new script system, will we be able to make NPCs
    unspawn after a certain amount of time or an event? (Laocourn, 1 votes)</a>
  <li><a href="#83">Will you ever be implementing a young system for the
    emulator? similar or working as OSI's? (PoseidonXIX, 1 votes)</a>
  <li><a href="#84">In your next build will you fix the T2A walking bug? where
    you fall down cliffs and cant walk up? (PoseidonXIX, 1 votes)</a>
  <li><a href="#85">When can we expect seeing the 'banaccount and 'addaccount
    commands to be functional? (PoseidonXIX, 1 votes)</a>
  <li><a href="#86">Have you noticed PVP crashing issues? Last night on build
    20c I was playing with some friends and whenever we'd get a hit on each
    other the server would crash. (Antitheus, 1 votes)</a>
  <li><a href="#87">Is a change to townstones\factions in the works? (Antitheus,
    1 votes)</a>
  <li><a href="#88">How do you plan to compensate for OSI's super duper secret
    project, UO:3D? Talk of a completely new client and MULs, etc. In my eyes
    this could tear apart any and all emus dependent upon it's client and MULs.

  <li><a href="#89">What's the official uox3 dev team favorite fast food? =p (Antitheus,
    1 votes)</a>
  <li><a href="#90">Currently there is a rather annoying bug in UOX causing
    Shopkeepers to have miss-named items for sale, e.g. the icon of a Chain
    Tunic with the description of a Pitchfork, one of the causes for this is
    adding items to a vendors pack in-game, any chance for a fix in the near
    future? (Zane, 1 votes)</a>

  <li><a href="#94">One bug that has bothered me for a while.. and it still
    seems to be going on, when two monsters are attacking a player, or two
    players a monster, or any combination thereof, the one being attacked seems
    unable to fight back, has this been looked into? (Zane, 1 votes)</a>
  <li><a href="#95">I asked this question a couple of UOX3HOCs back, but when
    ARE you guys gonna get some HOT girls to code for UOX3? :) (Lump_The_No-Legged_Gamer,

      alternate each week. This week is a HoC chat, next week it will be a

      with a lot of hooks into the server, and allowing you to spawn things,

    <td>Please people, read the previous HoC logs. They're available at
      www.uoxdev.com. This question specifically was answered last time. But to
      recap
  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon
    <td>No, it's not likely. We've had basically no requests for this
      functionality at all, and we don't know how appropriate it may be. PR
      shard players tend not to be complete novices, and skill/stat gain is
      generally much faster on these shards.
  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon
    <td>If there's a screaming desire for it, then we'll definitely have a look
      at a young system. But from my last request, absolutely no one emailed me
      requesting it.

  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon
    <td>Well, I've scoured the boards today, and I haven't finished looking yet.
      There was a post about bugs in t2a, but there was almost no details at
      all, and not even sure if they were using 20c (You are using 20c, yes?
      :&gt;)
  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon
    <td>If people can email me with distinct descriptions, locations, and
      circumstances, then it can be looked into. But &quot;the t2a walking
      bug&quot; is almost meaningless in trying to track it down.
  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon
    <td>My other thought is this: Last I checked, if you fell down a cliff, you
      couldn't walk back up it anyway (I mean, it is a cliff, and it's sheer

  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon
    <td>Well, one of the things that EviLDeD and myself have been working on is
      a much improved accounting system. The way it is currently implemented is
      poor, and it needs a complete work over, not a few patches, and that's
      being worked on by EviLDeD. It will likely come in with the new
      rearchitected version of UOX (same time as the Scripting engine)

  <tr>

    <td>No one has reported these issues to us. I haven't seen any posts on the
      board at all either. If you can reproduce it consistently, record a set of
      steps and information required to test it, and email it to me, Xuri, or
      submit it via the bug board

  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon
    <td>Well, the secret nature of it means it wouldn't be a simple thing to
      deal with. HOWEVER, I don't imagine it's particular insurmountable. I
      would be shocked if they redid both the client packet format and the mul
      files, because that would essentially mean redoing the client entirely. It
      may be what they're doing, but it would have a big effect on the server
      too.
  <tr>
    <td width="5%" valign="TOP">Abaddon
    <td>It'll be dealt with, there will be support for it long term, I can
      pretty much guarantee it. There's a lot of people who have a lot of

      UOX's fault :&gt; It's actually an OSI client issue. This does happen
      sometimes on OSI servers, and it happens to other emus as well. I imagine
      there are ways for us to minimize this situation, and we will look into
      it. But it's not entirely our fault :&gt;

    <td>Things are progressing nice and well on the improvements. I had a chance
      to work some more last night (been short of time recently). All known
