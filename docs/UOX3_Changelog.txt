------------------------

-==============================-
-= 08/11/2020 - UOX3 0.99.4  =-
-==============================-
Contributors: Xuri, punt, dragon slayer

Source Changes/Fixes:
	Updated warning messages printed in UOX3 when attempting to inherit an invalid/non-existent item or character script entry using the GET tag, to also include the name of the script entry being inherited
	Added new tag for ore types in skills.dfn that determines default chance of finding a particular ore (can be overridden via OREPREFS tag in regions.dfn):
		ORECHANCE - takes a value from 0 to 1000, where 1000 equals 100.0%
	OREPREFS tag in regions.dfn now uses [sectionName] of ore type from skills.dfn instead of actual name of the ore
	OREPREFS tag in regions.dfn now uses comma as separator instead of space. New syntax: OREPREFS=[oreType,oreChance]
	Added chance of getting different ore sizes when mining
	Added functionality to combine and transform larger ores into smaller ores by double-clicking some ore and targeting other ore instead of a forge
	Added functionality to return different amount of ingots when smelting ore, based on the size of ore being melted
	Fixed a bug introduced in 0.99.3 that would set invalid values for certain properties on newly created items and NPCs if the tag for that property in the DFNs accepted random values, but only supplied one value. Example: Amount=1, vs Amount=10 20. As part of the fix for this, added sanity checking for all item and character DFN tags that accept two values.
	Fixed weapon damage not appearing in status gump
	Fixed a spidermonkey compilation issue with xcode 12.0.1/Apple clang v 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.2) (punt)
	Updated JS item properties MORE, MOREX, MOREY, MOREZ and SERIAL, and character property SERIAL, to pass values to JS scripts using JS_NewNumberValue() instead of INT_TO_JSVAL if the property value cannot fit inside JSVAL (checked with INT_FITS_IN_JSVAL)
	Added support in CResponse.cpp for client trigger word for securing containers in houses - TW_HOUSESECURE
	Updated CMulHandler::CheckStaticFlag() to match with statics that cover/extend across the specified Z coordinate, not just ones that have the same base Z level
	Updated CMulHandler::DoesMapBlock() to not deem map tiles as blocking if they are more than 16 Z (height of a character) higher than the specified Z coordinate to check
	Exposed method for finding corners of a multi to JS engine:
		.GetMultiCorner( cornerID ) - Gets coordinates for specified corner of multi (0 = NW, 1 = NE, 2 = SW, 3 = SE)
	Exposed various functions related to map, statics and multis to JS engine:
		CalcMultiFromSer( serial ) - Find a multi from a provided serial
		GetMapElevation( x, y, z, world) - Returns the map elevation at specified coordinates
		IsInBuilding( x, y, z, world, instance, checkHeight ) - Returns true if the specified location is inside a static building (underneath static items), or if player is inside a multi. If the checkHeight argument is true, player is only deemed inside a multi if there are multi-items above the player's head. If player is in a courtyard/on a rooftop, they will be deemed to be NOT in the building. checkHeight is not used for the static part of the function.
		CheckStaticFlag( x, y, z, world, tileFlagID ) - Checks to see if any statics at given coordinates has specified tile flag
		DoesStaticBlock( x, y, z, world, checkWater ) - Checks if statics at/above given location blocks characters
		DoesDynamicBlock( x, y, z, world, instance, checkWater, waterWalk ) - Checks if dynamics at/above given location blocks characters
		DoesMapBlock( x, y, z, world, checkWater, waterWalk ) - Checks if map tile at/above given location blocks characters
	Fixed an issue with validation of DFN tags for items and NPCs being loaded from scripts
	Fixed UOX3 not writing out names of item/NPC DFN sections with invalid data in tags
	Fixed an issue where non-GM characters could not open their own backpacks or take items from other containers or corpses due to some flawed comparisons of worldnumber/instanceID between character and items

	Added new type of house privilege in cMultiObj.cpp to keep track of guests of the multi - HOUSEPRIV_GUEST - which is stored during worldsaves as one or more Guest=<player serial> tags in house.wsc
	When items are created for houses upon house placement, a reference to the multi's serial is now stored in the house sign's MORE property to allow easier tracking of which house a particular sign belongs to
	Added tracking of new, persistent properties for houses via cMultiObj.cpp/h:

		Fixed an issue where GMs could be banned from player houses
		Added Line of Sight checks to speech, to give players some privacy in their own homes

	Fixed a bug when checking if dynamic items were blocking valid spawn locations for NPCs, some function arguments were in the wrong order!
	Improved code that finds valid spawn locations for items and NPCs spawned via spawn regions. As server gradually builds up lists of valid spawn locations per region over time, it will start using these lists more often, rather than always look for brand new spawn locations.

	Exposed character property .accountNum to JS engine
	Extended CDataList class to include a Clear() method for clearing lists
	Updated JS File method .Open() to support an optional, third argument - subFolderName - that defines in which sub-folder of UOX3/shared/ to store/look for a file. If no third argument is supplied, UOX3 will default to using the shared folder itself.
	Updated JS File method .Length() to return a value of -1 for files that don't exist
	Added new code function, exposed to JS engine with same parameters, which simply checks if a given tile ID has a specific flag

		FindRootContainer( itemSerial )
		FindRootContainer( item )

		bool DeleteFile( fileName, subFolderName )
	Added new JS functions for checking if a specific client or server feature is enabled. See documentation for full list of client/server features.
		GetClientFeature( bitNum ) // Returns true if specified client feature is enabled on server
		GetServerFeature( bitNum ) // Returns true if specified server feature is enabled on server
	Added new JS function for returning the value of almost any server setting from UOX.INI
		GetServerSetting( settingNameInDoubleQuotes )
	Updated JS function DoesDynamicBlock() with two new parameters - checkOnlyMultis and checkOnlyNonMultis
	Updated JS function DoesMapBlock() with two new parameters - checkMultiPlacement and checkForRoad
	Fixed an issue where a LoS check would prevent players from accessing containers in their own backpack
	Added new functions in findfuncs.cpp to make it easier to find items near another object or location:
		findNearbyItems( object, distance )
		findNearbyItems( x, y, worldNumber, instanceID, distance )
	Added new Item property - maxItems - used by containers to determine their max item capacity
	Added new Item property - totalItemCount - used to get total item count in a container (including sub-containers)
	Added check for max item capacity when creating new items that are added to a character's backpack - items will be created below character's feet if backpack is full!
	Added new DFN tag for items, used by containers to determine item capacity for a given container:
		MAXITEMS=# // 125 is the default for all containers if not set
	Added new JS Item properties:
		.maxItems // gets/sets item capacity for a given container
		.totalItemCount // gets total item count in a container, including sub-containers
	Updated item tooltips for containers to show accurate total item count, as well as to display max item capacity
	Fixed a bug where picking up items from a non-locked down pile of items on the floor inside a multi could cause the remaining pile to be seen as no longer inside the multi, disallowing locking it back down and causing it to decay based on regular decay timer instead of house-specific one
	Updated various JS scripts and hardcoded targeting functions to disallow the targeting of locked down resources using skills and tools
	Updated JS Method TextMessage() to support three extra, optional parameters. Note that if one optional parameter is included, all preceding optional parameters are also required!
		speechTarget - What kind of target is this message intended for?
			0 - Only visible for sender and receiver of message
			1 - Visible to all players in range
			2 - Visible to all NPCs and players in range
			3 - Visible to all PCs everywhere + NPCs in range
			4 - Visible to all PCs everywhere (broadcast)
			5 - Only visible for the receiver of the message
		speechTargetSerial - The serial of the receiver of the message, used if speechTarget is 0 or 5
		speechFontType - The type of font to display the text in. Defaults to normal.
		    0 - Bold
		    1 - Normal with shadow
		    2 - Bold with shadow
		    3 - Normal
		    4 - Gothic
		    5 - Italic
		    6 - Small, dark

	Fixed some a couple of issues with compiling on Linux.
	Fixed an issue with tradetimestamp for houses
	Updated JS command set to support setting language for player characters directly instead of getting it from UO client - though it will still attempt to do this if selected language is ZERO. Useful for testing multiple languages, and also opens up for possibility of letting players/GMs choose a language manually!
	Fixed a server crash caused by container tooltip updates being attempted sent to invalid sockets in PlaceItem() function of items.cpp
	Fixed an issue with books where server could get stuck in an infinite loop if number of lines per page was higher than 8. Now capped at 8 lines per page.
	Renamed item type enum IT_READABLEBOOK to IT_BOOK, since it's the item type used by both readable and writeable books.
	Changed ANIMALATTACKCHANCE to use a scale of 1 to 1000 instead of 1 to 100, for additional granularity in setting the chance for animals to get attacked by monsters. An INI value of 15 now translates as 1.5% chance (per NPC AI cycle!) instead of the previous 15%
	Removed new GetEnvironment() function and expanded on the use of the existing OS_STR define in Config.h
	Updated fireworks wand (IT_FIREWORKSWAND) so effects no longer play permanently in ClassicUO client
	Removed some unused item types that have been marked as candidates for deletion for over 15 years (IT_CHAOSGATEOPENER, IT_CHAOSGATE, IT_GUILLOTINEANIM, IT_TRAININGDUMMYANIM)!
	Fixed an issue with advanced pathfinding where NPCs in some cases would stop 1 tile before reaching the target location
	Fixed an issue where no crafting resources would ever be lost if failing to craft an item that only required 1 of a given crafting resource
	Fixed an issue with pathfinding that could cause NPCs to queue up in long rows when attempting to reach the same target in combat when advanced pathfinding was disabled
	Added functionality to allow guild masters to move guildstones by transforming these into portable stones that can be used to place the guildstones in new locations
	Updated timestamp for packet logs to include milliseconds for greater granularity
	Another attempt at fixing a crash on shutdowns caused by encountering fatal errors

	Updated js/items/axe.js to support chopping up trash barrels and house add-ons in houses owned by the player
	Implemented strongboxes (js/server/house/strongbox.js) for co-owners of a house, which can be placed with the house command "i wish to place a strongbox". Max capacity is 25 items

	Updated RandomNum function to use a "seedless" random number generator from C++11 instead of the old C rand() function.
	Overall code cleanup to remove/replace platform-dependent code
	Replaced potentially unsafe usage of C string stuff like sprintf, vsprintf, vsnprintf, strncat, strcpy and strlen throughout the code with calls to a format() function containing only a single, safe use of vsnprintf, ensuring there's a single place of failure if there's anything to fix and and making it easy to potentially replace this with std::format from C++20 when the time comes.
	Replaced usage of char in many places with std::string
	Started process of replacing UString usage with functions provided through StringUtility instead
	Replaced platform specific fileIO handling in Windows/Linux with cross-platform C++17 standard std::filesystem
	Replaced platform specific time handling by using cross-platform chrono library
	Removed UOX namespace to reduce complexity
	Elimitated template code approach to singletons for more modern c++ constructs, removing dependices in the process
	Removed ODBC support; it hasn't been touched since the initial implementation in 2008, and there is a lack of someone to maintain the code.
	Removed some platform specific files like uoxlinux.h, which is no longer required
	Removed legacy crash protection code, and removed support for cluox
	Removed legacy "support" for Borland compiler
	Removed legacy VC++ 6 Workspace/Project files, VS2005 Solution/Project files, as these are no longer supported
	Removed legacy BUILD folder with outdated compilation instructions
	Removed old Changelog file (merged into Changelog.txt)
	Fixed a pointer bug for items in multis on world load
	Fixed a dictionary related issue that caused segmentation faults on Linux/MacOS
	Fixed an issue with callbacks to JS scripts that caused segmentation faults on Linux/MacOS
	Paths in uox.ini should now load properly on all platforms regardless of whether those paths use slashes or backslashes, and whether or not they end in a slash/backslash
	Moved to c++17 style of threading, and got rid of threadsafeobject.cpp/h
	Replaced parsing of UOX.INI tags with a system that's more easily maintainable
	Misc code cleanup to reduce amount of warnings and increase cross-platform compatibility
	Removed Platform.h from project, select portions moved to Config.h
	Improvements to handling of UOP format; now takes a cleaner approach, loads files faster
	All references in code and scripts to "midi" changed to "music", to reflect fact that modern clients don't actually even have midi files. This change covers both GM commands, DFN tags in regions.dfn and JS methods/properties.
	Added new socket property for storing temporary int in JS - tempInt2
	Added new socket property for storing temporary object in JS - tempObj2
	Fixed an issue that prevented characters from vanishing from the the sight of players when teleporting to a different instance
	Added support for ClassicUO client's WorldMap tracking packet (0xf0) for guildmembers/partymembers. This is the same packet as Razor uses for feature negotiation, so merged the handling of those two packets together into CPIKrriosClientSpecial, which can also be extended to handle other uses of this packet.
	Added new UOX.INI setting  whether shard should respond to ClassicUO client's WorldMap tracking packets for guildmembers/partymembers
		CLASSICUOMAPTRACKER=0
	Added support (UOPInterface.cpp/hpp) for loading map files in UOP format, allowing UOX3 to use map files from clients up to at least v7.0.86.2 without requiring files to be converted to mul format first. Loading of UOP files is slower than for equivalent mul files, but after startup, the performance of lookups remains the same for both
	Updated TWEAK, INFO in code and ISTATS, CSTATS in gumps.js to display 4-digit hex-ids for IDs consistently in the format of 0x####
	Fixed issue that would disconnect ClassicUO users if they used WorldMap feature in the client, via CPIKrriosClientSpecial() handler in CPacketReceive.cpp/h, which will handle all things packet 0xF0. As of yet it doesn't respond correctly to the WorldMap-related version of the packet, but at least it no longer disconnects this client from the server.
	Fixed an issue with CPSendGumpMenu::AddText() that caused guildstones and townstones to crash server when used
	Fixed an issue with CTownRegion::DisplayTownMenu() that prevented players from joining a town when interacting with a townstone for the first time
	Replaced platform specific ways of looking up and loading DFN files in cServerDefinitions.cpp with a common, cross-platform method using std::filesystem. This also fixes an issue with loading of map0.mul on Linux when maps.4xclients.old is present in dfndata/maps/ directory
	Misc changes to address errors and warnings when compiling on 64bit Linux
		%li changed to %i
		%lu changed to %u
		Some (SERIAL) changed to (UI64)
		Some size_t changed to UI32
	Embraced the usage of R32, R64, SI16, UI16, SI32, UI32, SI64 and UI64 typedef aliases as replacement for built-in types throughout the sourcecode:
		typedef float				R32;
		typedef double				R64;
		typedef signed char			SI08;
		typedef unsigned char		UI08;
		typedef signed short int	SI16;
		typedef unsigned short int	UI16;
		typedef signed int			SI32;
		typedef unsigned int		UI32;
		typedef signed long long	SI64;
		typedef unsigned long long	UI64;
	As part of this process, UI32 was redefined from unsigned long int to unsigned int, and SI32 from signed long int to signed int to ensure the size of variables using these remain the same (32bit) across both Windows, Linux and MacOS for both 32bit and 64bit platforms
	Replaced instances of toLong() with toInt(), and toULong() to toUInt()
	Replaced instances of "long" and "int" with SI32 where possible
	Replaced instances of "unsigned long" and "unsigned int" with UI32 where possible
	Replaced instances of "float" with R32 where possible
	Fixed an issue with void CSpawnRegion::SetNPCList() and void CSpawnRegion::SetItemList() that could cause compilation to fail on Linux
	Added an FX playing for successful uses of the parrying skill
	Successfully parrying an attack will send a sysmessage to the player informing them of their feat, if DISPLAYHITMSG is enabled in UOX.INI
	Fixed placing a house addon teleporting player to the location of the addon
	Added support for TELEPORT tag to regions.dfn. If set to 0, use of the Teleport spell is not allowed in a given region. Defaults to 1 if not specified.
	Exposed canTeleport JS property for regions
	Added missing UOX.INI settings for feature negotation, as mentioned in previous commit!
	Added support for feature negotiation with Razor, AssistUO and other assistant tools that support this feature via new UOX.INI settings:
		ASSISTANTNEGOTIATION=0 		// If enabled (1), sends a request (packet 0xF0) to negotiate features with assistant tools upon login. Defaults to (0)
		KICKONASSISTANTSILENCE=0 	// If enabled (1), disconnects clients that don't respond (with packet 0xF0) to request via assistant tool within 30 seconds. Defaults to (0)
	Added new section at bottom of UOX.INI to allow shard admins to control which assistant features get disabled:
		[disabled assistant features]
		{
		AF_FILTERWEATHER=0 		// Weather Filter
		AF_FILTERLIGHT=0 		// Light Filter
		AF_SMARTTARGET=0 		// Smart Last Target
		AF_RANGEDTARGET=0 		// Range Check Last Target
		AF_AUTOOPENDOORS=0 		// Automatically Open Doors
		AF_DEQUIPONCAST=0 		// Unequip Weapon on spell cast
		AF_AUTOPOTIONEQUIP=0 	// Un/Re-equip weapon on potion use
		AF_POISONEDCHECKS=0 	// Block heal If poisoned/Macro IIf Poisoned condition/Heal or Cure self
		AF_LOOPEDMACROS=0 		// Disallow Looping macros, For loops, and macros that call other macros
		AF_USEONCEAGENT=0 		// The use once agent
		AF_RESTOCKAGENT=0 		// The restock agent
		AF_SELLAGENT=0 			// The sell agent
		AF_BUYAGENT=0 			// The buy agent
		AF_POTIONHOTKEYS=0 		// All potion hotkeys
		AF_RANDOMTARGETS=0 		// All random target hotkeys (Not target next, last target, target self)
		AF_CLOSESTTARGETS=0 	// All closest target hotkeys
		AF_OVERHEADHEALTH=0 	// Health and Mana/Stam messages shown over player's heads
		AF_AUTOLOOTAGENT=0 		// (AssistUO only) The autoloot agent
		AF_BONECUTTERAGENT=0 	// (AssistUO only) The bone cutter agent
		AF_JSCRIPTMACROS=0 		// (AssistUO only) Javascript macro engine
		AF_AUTOREMOUNT=0 		// (AssistUO only) Auto remount after dismount
		AF_ALL=0 				// All features
		}

		Updated and standardized function comment blocks throughout entire codebase
		Grouped getters and setters together in pairs and documented them as one
		Removed empty and/or non-useful information from comment blocks
		Removed unused function from cItem.cpp/h - IncID() - formerly used to change IDs for doors
	Added new feature - Instances
		Objects (characters, items, multis, spawnregions) can now make use of a 5th parameter to determine their location in the game world. In addition to the traditional X, Y, Z and WORLDNUMBER parameters, a new one has been added - INSTANCEID - that allows objects to exist at the same coordinates in the same world, but in different "dimensions". Code has been updated in multiple places to support this, and a default instanceID of 0 is assumed if nothing else is specified.

	Expanded the maximum amount of available regions in regions.dfn from 255 to 65535
	Minor cleanup done in various parts of the source

		Updated supported syntax goes as follows, with optional parameters shown in paranthesis:
			LOOT=lootlist
			LOOT=lootlist,amount
			LOOT=lootlist,minamount maxamount

	Updated timers for curing and healing in js/skill/healing.js - should now take longer to heal/cure oneself with bandages than to do the same with others
	Added new JS command: 'FIXCONTWEIGHT - will iterate through all in-game containers and update their baseWeight (forced), weight (if empty and not already set) and weightMax (if not already set) properties

DFN Changes/Fixes:
	Added missing script=5021 tag to the bedroll in DFNDATA/ITEMS/GEAR/provisions.dfn

	Fixed some incorrect values for WEIGHT-tags in dfndata/items/gear/armor/base_armor.dfn
	Potentially fixed an issue with the Stone Walls/Stone Walls 2-sections of the add-menu, which could cause lengthy stalls when opened across network connections

		WEIGHTMAX=# (defaults to 40000 - or 400.00 stones - for all containers)
	Added container-capactity information to item tooltip
	Added "Locked Down" text to item tooltips for locked down items. Refresh seems funky though.

			SI16 CalcSpellDamageMod( CChar *caster, CChar *target, SI16 baseDamage, bool spellResisted )
		Updated cMagic::CheckResist() with magic resistance formulas based on pre-AoS information
		Added BASEDMG tag to a number of spells in DFNDATA/SPELLS/spells.dfn.
			For damage-spells, it's the maximum potential basedamage done before bonuses (or penalties) based on target resist, caster eval int and item resistances.
			For healing spells, it's the maximum potential basehealing done before potential bonuses
		Damage-spells updated to use new methods for calculating damage and magic resistances, both of which should now be close to pre-AoS implementation
		Changed Chain Lightning and Meteor Swarm spells to split the total damage done between all targets
		Mind Blast changes:
			Mind Blast will now never exceed 60% of target max-health, nor above 120% of BASEDMG
			If target's Int stat makes out a larger percentage of his/her total stats (Sum of Str, Dex, Int) than the caster's, spell backfires onto caster
		Debuff-spells like Clumsy, Feeblemind, Weaken and Curse can no longer be fully resisted. Resisting will halve the effect-duration instead.

	Added container-gump support for container items like bones and various SE/SA-related containers
	Corrected sound-effect played when dropping items into baskets of various kinds
	Fixed a bug where NPCs would continue following and attacking characters that turned invisible/hidden
	Players who turn invisible will now stop swinging at nearby targets in combat
	Fixed a bug where players could equip both one-hander and two-hander weapons at the same time
	Fixed a bug where newly created characters could end with two conflicting weapons equipped at the same time
	Added fix to properly set the mounted-state for NPCs that spawn with a mount-item pre-equipped
	Fixed issue where there was no distance-check on Field-spells. They now use CombatMaxSpellRange setting from UOX.INI like other spells
	Fixed issue where the wrong GFX would be displayed for Field-spells aligned north/south
	Fixed issue where NPCs without fencing or swordsmanship would not be allowed to poison anyone in combat. Tough luck, spiders!
	Fixed issue with some NPCs using invalid values for POISONSTRENGTH. The valid range of poisons goes from 1 (weak) to 4 (deadly).
	Fixed an issue where containers with specific MORE values were interpreted as being trapped. Trapped containers now use MOREZ instead of MORE.
	Fixed some issues with boat-movement (drifting/turning left/right, in particular) being blocked in cases where it shouldn't be
	Fixed an issue where boat-commands to drift left/right could be spammed to move boat at high speeds. Now limited to normal boat speed multiplied by 1.5
	Fixed an issue where static water tiles would block placement of boats
	Fixed Tillerman-location on large ships turned southwards
	Nearby pets will now teleport along with their owner into/onto houses/boats when those are placed

	Parts of movement code rewritten to solve Z-related issues (xantier)
	Fixed various other issues with the walking-code
	Removed hacky workaround for bug with NPC pathfinding leading to queues of NPCs all lined up, replaced by proper pathfinding
	Made some tweaks to various parts of the NPC pathfinding code
		Reduced default maxSteps variable in advanced pathfinding routine from 1000 steps to 500 steps for performance reasons
			The maxSteps variable will also increase/decrease depending on the type of movement the pathfinding is for
		Added a safeguard against NPCs repeatedly failing at advanced pathfinding and slowing down the server as a result. Now resets their NPCWANDERMODE on critical failures.
		Added an internal counter for NPCs called "failPath", which increases whenever the NPC is blocked from moving when server thinks it has a valid path.
			Once it reaches a certain threshold, NPC can push past a blocking character, or alternatively stop whatever it's doing (fleeing, following, etc).
		Advanced Pathfinding will now take into account characters blocking the way when generating valid paths - no more queued up NPCs in long lines!
		Enabled pathfinding in water for water-walking creatures
		NPCs that fail to pathfind while fleeing will abort fleeing and re-engage their opponent in combat
		NPCs that fail to pathfind while in combat will abort combat and enter a state of "evasion" for a short time, during which
			...Other characters wont block their movement
			...They can't be attacked
			...They won't attack anyone
			...They'll try to move back to their bounding box, if they have one
	Added some randomization in how NPCs pick their targets in combat, so not all NPCs pick the same target at the same time
	MAX_VISRANGE and DEFSOCK_RANGE increased from 15 to 18 to better deal with item-updates in higher-resolution clients
	JS events OnDeathBlow and OnDispel can now be used to override death and/or dispelling of summoned creatures (and magical fields), by returning false from the script
		Note that for OnDeathBlow overriding code means that things like fame/karma-calculations and criminal/murderer-flags and timers need to be manually set in the script
	Improvements to LineOfSight-code:
		LoS no longer checks against a hardcoded list of items, but instead uses tiledata-flags (missing flags can be overriden through tiles.dfn)
		LoS-checks will no longer be done for NPCs against targets that have visible status VT_PERMHIDDEN or VT_GHOSTHIDDED
		LoS-checks should now work more consistently - no more NPCs aggroing players through walls! (Eolirin)
			Note that this also has a benefit for server performance, as less aggroing NPCs mean less unneccesary attempts at NPC pathfinding!
	Added support for INVISIBLE tag for house-items in DFNDATA\HOUSE\house.dfn. Allows adding invisible items to houses.
	Updated methods for detecting client-versions for incoming connections, and how these are stored on the socket object
	Added support for Stygian Abyss clients (classic version only, from v6.0.14.2 to 7.0.8.2)
	Added support for High Seas clients (classic version only, from v7.0.9.0 to 7.0.15.1?)
	Added support for creation of SA-specific Gargoyle-characters if client and server support this through CLIENTFEATURES and SERVERFEATURES bits
		NOTE: Gargoyle-specific features and/or special-cases are not yet implemented! Highly experimental.
	Added support for extended itemIDs (0x3FFF to 0xFFFF) used in SA and HS clients. Maximum supported depends on size of tiledata run on the server.
	Added support for reading new versions of tiledata.mul and multi.mul. No settings needed, version-handling taken care of automatically.
	Added support for New Object Information packet (0xF3) via CPNewObjectInfo packet class.
		This replaces packet 0x1A in client-versions 7.0+, and enables displaying items and multis with IDs extending beyond 0x3FFF
	Added support for packet 0xD7, SubCommand 0x28 - Guild button on paperdoll, which gives access to guild-functions if character belongs to a guild.
		Can be enabled/disabled through UOX.INI setting PAPERDOLLGUILDBUTTON=0/1. Defaults to 0.
	Updated packet 0x88 to properly show combat-status of character in paperdoll
	Updated packet 0xBA (Tracking Arrow) for HS clients - from 6 bytes to 10 bytes, to include target serial.
	Updated packet 0x99 (Multi Placement) for HS clients - from 26 to 30 bytes, to include multi hues.
	Added new NPCAI for passive NPCs who can be attacked, but will never attack back: AI_PASSIVE = 7
	Updated Wall of Stone-spell to no longer place walls on the same tiles as where characters are standing
	Added brute-force updating of character's total weight when main backpack is opened, as a quick-fix for broken character weights
	Updated packet 0xA9 (Character List/Starting Locations) with UO:SA and UO:HS-specific handling.
	Updated packet 0x24 (Draw Container, from 7 to 9 bytes) to support Container Type-flag in UO:HS clients, to ensure that containers, spellbooks and vendors continue working.
	Changed the upper limit for the amount of stamina that can contribute to faster attack-speeds (for NPCs only) from 100 to 300
		This increases their maximum theoretical attack-speed from attacking every 1.5 seconds to roughly every 0.75 seconds
	Earthquake-spells will no longer affect mounted targets, animation-wise
	Added new UOX.INI option to determine whether attack-speed bonuses are gained from Stamina (default) or Dexterity: ATTACKSPEEDFROMSTAMINA=1/0
	Added new UOX.INI option to control the displaying of damage-numbers in combat (previously used DISPLAYHITMSG for numbers too): DISPLAYDAMAGENUMBERS=1/0
	Implemented better support for Yell (1.5 * normal speech distance) and Whisper (1 tile distance for players, 3 for GMs)
	Whispering will no longer take hidden players out of hiding
	Normal players can no longer see regular speech from permanently hidden GMs or Counselors
	Normal players can see whispers from permanently hidden GMs or Counselors, if they're within distance (3 tiles)
	Added a new section to UOX.INI - [clientsupport] - along with the following settings to determine approved client-versions for the server:
		CLIENTSUPPORT4000=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT5000=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT6000=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT6050=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT7000=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT7090=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT70160=0/1
		CLIENTSUPPORT70240=0/1
		NOTE: Each of these settings represent a range of clients, not just the individual versions mentioned. This means that CLIENTSUPPORT4000, for instance,
		 will allow or disallow connections from clients 4.0.0 to 4.0.11f. Also note that while it is possible to enable support for all clients at the same time,
		 it highly recommended to restrict support for client versions that match up to what the server is running.
	Fixed various issues with the skill-gump (crashes) and skill-locks (not working/showing weird gumps instead of arrows/lock)
	Added new UOX.INI option: EXTENDEDSTARTINGSTATS=0/1
		If enabled, makes new characters start with 90 statpoints (selectable in clients 7.0.16.0+ only, lower versions only get 90 if using templates) instead of 80.
	Added new UOX.INI option: EXTENDEDSTARTINGSKILLS=0/1
		If enabled, allows for four starting skills (selectable in clients 7.0.16.0+ only, lower versions only get 4th skill if using templates) instead of three
	Added (very) experimental support for UO:Enhanced clients v4.0.23.1+
	Did some minor code-cleanup stuff, including but not limited to:
		Reduced scope of some local variables to where they are actually needed/used
		Changed some const std::strings function parameters to references instead of values
		Changed some "stuff.size() == 0"-checks to "stuff.empty()"
		Changed some "stuff.size() != 0"-checks to "!stuff.empty()"
		Removed some variables that were initialized but never used
	Increased world-loading speeds by ~35-40%, and saving by ~30-35% (your mileage may vary, this was tested on Windows 7, on an SSD)
	Included <climits> in mapstuff.h and <stdlib.h> in cDice.cpp to fix a compiling issue in Linux
	Made the WIPEABLE bit a member of cBaseObj instead of cItem, so it can be used by both items, spawners, characters and multis - though only works for items and spawners atm
	Implemented support for automatically renaming books when the book titles are updated by players
	Fixed broken Bulletin Boards - should no longer freeze the client, and can actually be used for posting messages again

	 the player name and serial only to the char requesting the information.
	Fix the format of the pingIP field in the CPGameServerList::AddServer() function. Now the
	 client shows, after a moment, latency and packet loss information for the servers. It still

	 server hour and use their values for the amount of weather effects on the screen.
	Committed some linux build error fixes on behalf of Cavalier
	Allowed customization of supported client features via uox.ini
		CLIENTFEATURES
		SERVERFEATURES
		Note that these are bit-settings similar to the way STARTPRIV works.
		One will need knowledge of how to set individual bits in a value,
		or an editor to customize these features.
	Removed CLIENTSUPPORT from the uox.ini
	Fix the onCreate JS script functions, they used the same event id. So if one didn't exist the other was also marked as not existing.

	 by the client it now uses the first start location from the uox.ini instead of the fixed
	 location in britain.

	 IDs to see if an item is hair or a beard.

	Added a new setting to the uox.ini, LOOTINGISCRIME. If you set it to 0 looting
	 corpses of innocent chars is not taken as a crime.
	Fixed and changed parts of the walking code. If NPCs have the RUNS tag set they
	 will really run when they attack, instead of just showing the running animation.
	Tamed chars will now run, if the char they follow is running, this should reduce
	 the warping effect of them a bit.
	Remove some not needed code and slow fleeing NPCs a bit down, so that other chars
	 can still catch up with them.
	Make sure we check for scripts envoked by type or id before we use the global script.
	Added JavaScript function "Moon( moonNum, newVal )" which will get and set the server moon values.
	Modified JavaScript Item.decaytime and Item.tempTimer to calculate the new value as a future time in seconds (unless a 0 is passed).

	 work the same way as NPCMOVEMENTSPEED.
	Added three new DFN tags for NPCs. WALKINGSPEED, RUNNINGSPEED and FLEEINGSPEED
	 they also work the same way as the uox.ini settings, and will override those if present.
	Allow faster attacks on fleeing NPCs, so they won't be chased without an end.
	Allow following NPCs to run if their target went to far away, so they can catch up on it.

	Added support for updated UOKR packets.

	 tooltips will only contain basic information, like the name and the weight of an item.
	Use an enum for racial relations, should help with reading the code.
	Fix a bug where racial allys would attack each other.
	Added new JS property for items: "speed" this can be used to get and set the speed of weapons.
	Added new setting to spawn.dfn: "ONLYOUTSIDE" set this to one so that items and chars
	 will only spawn outside of buildings in that area.

	 keep within the spawnarea boundaries.
	Send NPCs that left their wander area for some reasons back there.

	Changed the tweakItem and tweakChar handlers to use command level rather than the "IsGM" flag.

	twice. (grimson)
	Changed CMapHandler::Load() so that PostLoadProcessing of chars is done after (grimson)
	PostLoadProcessing of items, or else the forced recalculation of the chars
	weight doesn't work. (grimson
	Added a version number to chars, it is defined in DEFCHAR_CHARVERSION and use it in
	CChar::DoVersionUpdates() to allow forced updates. Used this to force a weight recalculation
	on possibly bugged chars. (grimson)
	Removed version number for chars. (grimson)
	Added .tempWeight JS property to chars, so you can safely modify the weight of chars in scripts. (grimson)
	Added calcLowDamage() and calcHighDamage() functions to combat.cpp and use them in
	CPStatWindow::SetCharacter() to set the DamageMin and DamageMax values. (grimson)

	in cMagic::MagicDamage() and cMagic::PoisonDamage(). You can set the resistance for npcs
	using a new DFN tag:
		DAMAGERESIST=# # # # 	Where the first number is fire, the second cold, the third energy
					and the last number poison resistance.
	The resistance for a damage type will rise everytime you get hit by this damage type, but the
	higher your resistance already is the slower it will rise. (grimson)
	Added new ini setting: (grimson)
		USECHARRESISTANCE=# If this is set to 0 the chars resistance won't increase by itself.
	Slowed the increase of resistance quite a bit down. (grimson)

	Rewrote CMovement::calc_walk() to improve overall readability and speed. (giwo)
	Merged CMovement::calc_WaterWalk() with calc_walk(). (giwo)

	Renamed DFN tag DAMAGERESIST to ELEMENTRESIST and use it also for items. (grimson)
	Added DFN tag POISONDAMAGE to items so that they can also do poison damage on attacks. (grimson)

	to calculate the resistance against elements similiar to the def value of armor. (grimson)
	Changed AdjustRaceDamage() to also take into account the elemental resistance of the target. (grimson)
	Use calcElementDef() in MagicDamage() similiar to calcDef() in calcDamage() to take the
	elemental resistance into account. (grimson)
	Added element resistance calculation to weather damage. (grimson)
	Fixed calcElementDef() and getElementDef() so that the chars basic element resistance
	is always added. (grimson)
	Changed MagicDamage() so that we always do at least a little bit of damage. (grimson)
	Changed the z value for various LineOfSight() calls so that we actually check whether
	we can see the face of the targeted char instead of his feets. (grimson)
	Changed CPICreateCharacter::newbieItems() so that the default items aren't placed inside
	the players backpack until they have their final ID, to prevent the adding of wrong weight
	values. (grimson)
	Altered the CBO resistances code to use an array rather than a number of variables (Maarc)
	Note that we're still only saving out a subset of these resistances, because only a subset ever get checked at the moment
	This could easily change in future, with people wanting to use other elemental stuff
	Adjusted CItem::CopyData() so that it copies all the WeatherDamage values instead of only a couple (Maarc)
	Upgraded the container size on weatherBools, as the number of weather entries has moved beyond a UI08 size (Maarc)
	Changed CBaseObject::SetWeight() and CBaseObject::SetID() so they also update the weight
	of the container the item is in, when it is an item and when it is within a container. (grimson)
	Converted Numeric DFN's to a Signed Long rather than unsigned by default for *nix compatability. (giwo)
	Merged jr's fixes for cygwin compatability and fixing some minor gameplay issues. (giwo)
	Modified ModelBoat() to automatically move you off the boat (if near land). (giwo)
	Fixed a crash bug involving boats. (giwo)
	Changed several calls checking against type IT_PLANK to CanBeObjType( OT_BOAT ). (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing boat holds to "explode" when opening them. (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing containers inside containers on the ground to be "too far away". (giwo)
	Fixed item IDs for human corpses in newCarveTarget(). (grimson)
	Added PHYSICAL to WeatherType enum, so we can also use it represent physical damage. (grimson)
	Changed CChar::Damage() to handle armor and resistance effects, it also handles the repsys,
	peace breaking, elemental weakness, displays the damage, creates a reaction if an attacker
	is given and calls CChar::Die() if the hp drop below 1. It takes the following values: (grimson)
		SI16 damageValue	- The amount of damage to be done.
		CChar *attacker		- The char that caused the damage.
		bool doRepsys		- Do reputation handling (criminal, murderer, karma and fame).
		WeatherType damageType	- The type of damage, use NONE to ignore armor/resistance, use
					  PHYSICAL to use normal armor, anything above is elemental damage.
		SI08 hitLoc		- The hit location, use 0 for the complete body or -1 to randomly
					  calculate the hit location.
		UI08 fightSkill		- The skill used to create the damage.
		bool doArmorDamage	- Damage the armor part that has been hit.
	The JS function .damage can also take all of these values.
	Changed CChar::Die() to handle the death of chars, it takes two values: (grimson)
		CChar *attacker		- The char that caused the death.
		bool doRepsys		- Do reputation handling (murderer, karma and fame).
	Updated the usage of CChar::Damage() in most areas to reflect the changes and removed reputation
	and death handling in those areas as this is now taken care of by CChar::Damage(). (grimson)
	Fixed a combat issue allowing enemies to fight if on the exact same location but a different Z. (giwo)
	Modified guard handling so when guards are globally deactivated any existing guards will not teleport. (giwo)

	Fixed a possible issue causing doors to block LoS to themselves. (giwo)
	Updated playDeathSound to simplify some of the code for males/females (Maarc)
	Updated code so that we don't use MFLAGGET/MFLAGSET - apparently we have a std::bitset class that we
	 can use!  Also makes it somewhat more readable as well.  Cheers Punt for the suggestion. (Maarc)
	Renamed __ACCOUNTSADM_BLOCK__ to CAccountBlock (Maarc)
 	Removed dead code from accounts (stuff that was just never called at all) (Maarc)
	Removed Get/Set Word/Bit/BitRange from CBO, as it's not being used (Maarc)
	Removed genericDWords from CBO, as they're not being used, and are largely superfluous with custom int/string tags in JS (Maarc)
	Fixed an issue with AdvancedPathFinding() causing NPC's to flee constantly. (giwo)
	Fixed an issue with NPC fleeing that checked against Strength rather than MaxHP. (giwo)
	Defaulted weather damage to every 60 seconds (rather than every second) (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing a message to display damage taken by weather when no damage was taken. (giwo)

	Fixed an issue with LoS causing items to not block on a diagonal plane. (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing multi's not to block LoS. (giwo)
	Minor fixes, cleanups, and optimizations to LineOfSight. (giwo)
	Modified DoubleClick() so a character inside a multi can open an item outside a multi (as long as he can see it). (giwo)
	Changed CPICreateCharacter::newbieItems() so that it uses the newbie.dfn entrys [DEFAULT MALE] and
	[DEFAULT FEMALE] to add the basic clothing to new chars, and added those entrys to newbie.dfn. (grimson)
	Changed newCarveTarget() so that it uses the new [CARVE HUMAN] entry from carve.dfn to create the
	body parts, and added this entry to carve.dfn. Note: the second value used on the ADDITEM tags
	in the [CARVE HUMAN] entry is not an amount, it's the dictionary entry used for naming the body
	part. (grimson)
	Changed the INI loading code so that it uses a Script rather than custom code (Maarc)
	Moved defense modifications into CHandleCombat::ApplyDefenseModifiers(). (grimson)
	Moved damage bonuses into CHandleCombat::ApplyDamageBonuses(). (grimson)
	Moved the calculation of the hit location from CHandleCombat::DoHitMessage()
	into CHandleCombat::CalculateHitLoc(). (grimson)
	Added ReactOnDamage() to CCHar, currently it only makes the char attack the
	char that inflicted the damage. (grimson)
	Reduced CChar::Damage() to show, the damage, apply the damage, handle the
	reputation effect, the peace breaking effect and the chars death. (grimson)
	New JS functions:  (grimson)
		damage = ApplyDamageBonuses( damageType, attacker, defender, fightSkill, hitLoc, baseDamage );
			Note: Attacker and defender need to be valid chars.
		damage = ApplyDefenseModifiers( damageType, attacker, defender, fightSkill, hitLoc, baseDamage, doArmorDamage );
			Note: Attacker can be NULL, fightSkill will then be ignored.
	New char function: (grimson)
		mChar.ReactOnDamage( damageType, attacker );
			Note: damageType is currently unused.
	Changed char function: (grimson)
		mChar.Damage( amount, attacker, doRepsys );

	criminal flag. (grimson)
	I only added part of the ApplyDefenseModifiers() and ApplyDamageBonuses() changes to CVS,
	fixed it now. (grimson)
	Adjusted SE_ApplyDamageBonuses and SE_ApplyDefenseModifiers as they were using the same parameter
	 for attacker and defender (Maarc)
	Removed some unused properties/methods of the console that have never been used (Maarc)
	Begun construction of some placeholder code for party related works, not committing the factory code
	 until some testing can occur first (Maarc)
	Essentially, this just updates the handling for it which currently does nothing, and gives an insight into how it would
	 be done (Maarc)
	Changed CChar::Damage() to also display the damage to the owner of the attacker, so a
	player can also see the damage his pet does. (grimson)
	Another change to CChar::Damage(), if the attacker becomes criminal make the owner of it
	criminal too. (grimson)
	Changed CHandleCombat::ApplyDamageBonuses() so that elemental damage is doubled when the
	race is weak to that element, also double magic damage only on NPCs. (grimson)
	Changed CHandleCombat::Kill() so that only not tamed animals eat their victims. (grimson)
	Fixed CHandleCombat::calcDamage() I was submitting the base damage to the defense calculation. (grimson)

	Locally declared vector3D line2D and line3D as they are only used in lineofsight.cpp (giwo)
	Fixed water NPC's swimming under statics (bridges). (giwo)
	Fixed some false positives that were being generated by point3::Mag3D() by using a larger storage container. (giwo)
	Renamed Get/SetElementResist() to Get/SetResist as we now handle all resistance types in it. (grimson)
	Removed SetDef(), GetDef() and the def variable from CBaseobject.cpp and store armor values
	as physical resistance together with the other resistance values. (grimson)
	Removed calcElementDef(), getElementDef and checkElementDef from combat.cpp and handle all
	defence calculations in calcDef(), getArmorDef() and checkDef(). (grimson)
	Removed JS char property .armour and item property .def, added a new method for chars and
	items .Resist(). That method takes either one value, the resistance type and returns the
	resistance value of that char/item, or two values, the resistance type and the amount the
	resistance value should be set to. (grimson)
	Current resistance types are:
		1 - Armor
		2 - Light
		3 - Water
		4 - Cold
		5 - Heat
		6 - Energy
		7 - Poison
	The JS item property .devinelock was sent as INT though it is a bool. (grimson)
	Some small fixes to the tweak menu for items, this still had parts for a non existant MoreB
	value in it which shiftet some parts off, this also includes updated dictionaries. (grimson)

	Modified CChar::skilllocks and atrophy to save stat values to the worldfile. (giwo)
	Fixed an issue with CChar::skill value causing possible data corruption. (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing the Backpack entry on a popup menu to display as selectable when the character
		should not have a pack (IE a non-pack animal). (giwo)
	Made CBaseObject::SetWeight() a virtual function and overloaded it in CChar and CItem. (giwo)
	Modified CChar::SetWeight() to automatically Dirty our object for a statwindow update. (giwo)
	Simplified some DropItem() handling. (giwo)
	Moved CBaseObject updateTypes to CChar as there is only one type of item update, and added

	A small fix to ApplyDamageBonuses(), the race damage of a weapon was applied to the final
	damage instead of the weapons base damage. (grimson)
	Call the OnHungerChange JS event in the SetHunger() function of chars instead of calling
	it in every part of the code the where the hunger gets changed. (grimson)
	Added a new JS event: (grimson)
	onCombatDamageCalc( attacker, defender, getFightSkill )
		This event is called everytime combat damage is calculated. You can do your own damage
		calculation and return the damage to override the engine damage calculation, or return
		a negative damage value to use the engine damage calculation.
	Changed the return value of OnCombatDamageCalc() to a SI16, I accidentially declared it to be a SI32. (grimson)
	Replaced the JS Char property .defense with the new JS Char Method: (grimson)
		mChar.Defense( hitLoc, damageType, doArmorDamage );
	so you can get all the different defense values for a char.
	Removed the code to raise your resistance value upon elemental damage, this can be done better in JS. (grimson)
	Modified  CBaseObject::DumpBody() and CBaseObject::HandleLine() so that all resistance values get saved

		This will be fired everytime the char "damaged" gets damaged, the attacker can be a char or NULL.
	Small fix to ApplyDamageBonuses() caused by my previous commit. (grimson)
	Fixed a bug with the JS override for the combat damage calculation that caused 0
	damage to be applied when the attacker has no script attached and the global script
	doesn't exist eigther. (grimson)
	Minor changes to cSkills::Fish(). (giwo)
	Fixed an issue making it impossible to open Elven NPC paperdolls. (giwo)

	Modified JS Console Methods Warning() and Error() to remove the unused level value. (giwo)
	Fixed several issues with mapdiff and staticdiff handling. (giwo)
	Fixed a bug causing a crash when calling JS Event onGumpInput. (giwo)
	Merged CMultiObject vectors ownerList and banList into a single map housePrivList, to allow multiple owner/banned levels
		and ensure there are no duplicate characters on the lists. (giwo)
	Removed many superfluous uses of CChar::Dirty( UT_STATWINDOW ). (giwo)

JScript Changes/Fixes:
	Added NEWBIE option to JS SET command. (giwo)
	Updated JS scripts to use the new .Resist() method instead of .def/.armour (grimson)

	Moved foodlists.dfn into the itemlists folder, and replaced the FOOD= tags in the same file with FOODLIST= tags (Xuri)
	Correct items now added when studded sleeves/gloves are selected in the 'ADD menu (Xuri)
	Adjusted erroneous Z values in house.dfn (Causing outer doors to not be part of the multi). (giwo)
	Updated GM and Counsellor privs in commands.dfn, also placed a bit guide for the PRIVS value. (giwo)
	Removed default PRIV=0 tag from baseitem.dfn, as it would unset decayable value. (giwo)
	Changed PRIV1= tag to PRIV= in npc.dfn. (giwo)

-= 08/03/2006 - UOX3 0.98-3.5 =-
-==============================-

	JS Method .SetTag() now accepts boolean values (true/false). (giwo)
	Added AssocScript tag to effect saving (to make JS timers persistant). (giwo)
	Updated JS .SetPoisoned() to take one value for changing a poison value without setting a new timer. (giwo)

	Fixed several issues where items were not decayable that should be. (giwo)
	Defaulted JS CreateBlankItem() to set items to decayable. (giwo)
	Do an immediate update of the charflag and the char upon taming and un-taming. (grimson)
	First part of the rewrote hunger system: (grimson)
		Moved hunger calculations and immediate effects to CChar::DoHunger( )

		You can now set hunger dependend on races, this uses a new tag in races.dfn:
			HUNGER=#,# the first value is the hunger rate the second the hunger damage.
				   Note for players char the settings from the uox.ini apply if
				   there are no settings specified for the race.

		Re-activated the pet-hunger system. Pets will now become hungry and upon starving
		there is a configurable chance that they may become wild again. Note: Pets won't
		die from hunger and their hunger value is reset after becoming wild again. The
		hunger rate and the chance to become wild again can be configured by a new tag:
			TAMEDHUNGER=# # the first value is the hunger rate, the second the chance in %
					of the pet becoming wild again. Note: The values are seperated
					with a space instead of a comma on this tag.
		To feed a pet just drag some food on it, currently all types of food work.

		There is also another new DFN tag:
			WILLHUNGER=# if this is set to 0 the NPC will not suffer from any type of hunger.
				     Note: You can also change that value for specific chars by using
				     the already existing .willhunger JS property.
	Changed cCharStuff::addRandomLoot() to look for the lootlist inside the items folder because it is there. (grimson)
	Second part of the rewrote hunger system: (grimson)
		Added a new DFN tag for tamed pets:
			FOOD=abc   This sets the name of the foodlist for the tamed item.
		Added a new list type for items:
			FOODLIST   Defines a list of item IDs a tamed char will accept as food.

	Third part of the rewrote hunger system: (grimson)
		Added a new AI type "aiANIMAL" with the number 6. This AI does nothing until the hunger level
		reaches a value of 4, then it looks for other animals, that don't have the aiANIMAL, and attacks
		them. If the hunger level goes below 2 it will attack everything in range, even player chars.
		If the animal kills it's target it's hunger level will be set to 6 again.

		Added 3 new JS propertys for chars:
			.tamedHungerRate returns or sets the rate the char hungers when it is tamed.
			.hungerWildChance returns or sets the chance of the char becoming wild if it's starving.
			.foodList returns or sets the name of the foodlist for the char.

	Changed JS function CBase_Teleport() to prevent player chars from being teleport into a invalid world
	which rendered the player char useless as the client cannot login using that char afterwards. (grimson)
	Changed CheckCharInsideBuilding() to prevent a harmless error message when mounting a mount. (grimson)
	Tweaks to the new hunger system: (grimson)
		Tamed chars only hunger while the player that tamed them is online.
		Tamed mounts don't hunger when they are mounted by a player.
	Fixed a bug in CBase_Teleport() introduced by my earlier changes that caused teleports to other worlds
	to fail with big x and/or y coordinates. (grimson)
	Added three new ini settings: (grimson)
		PETHUNGEROFFLINE=0/1 	Sets whether pets should hunger while the player is offline or not.
		PETOFFLINETIMEOUT=#  	Sets the offline time of a player in days after that a pet becomes
					wild again.
		PETOFFLINECHECKTIMER=#	Sets the intervall in seconds between checks for the player offline
					time.

	Added 2 new NPC values to CChar to state whether the char has been mounted or stabled and check those
	in the DoHunger() and the new checkPetOfflineTimeout() functions. And made them available to the JS
	engine as the 2 new propertys: (grimson)
		.mounted	Can be used to get or set the mounted status
		.stabled	Can be used to get or set the stabled status
	Prevent spamming of weather packets when riding a boat. (grimson)
	Added a quick fix to the inMulti() function to make boats workable again. (grimson)
	Changed the HP and HPMAX tags so that you can set a minimum and maximum value. (grimson)
	Removed the IsMounted() function and replaced all it's calls with the GetMounted function. (grimson)
	Allow a food list to contain a link to another foodlist. (grimson)
	Changed TurnStuff() in boats.cpp to fix players getting stuck when turning the boat. (grimson)
	Added a Dirty( UT_LOCATION ) to HandleDeath() in pcmanage.cpp to make shure the player gets
	properly updated when he dies. (grimson)
	Fixed an issue causing players to not disembark boats properly. (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing boat holds not to be made part of the multi. (giwo)
	Updated the INI loading code to make it more verbose. (giwo)
	Removed "Golden" health until we know when (if ever) OSI uses it. (giwo)
	Created a new class, CJSEngine along with the files CJSEngine.cpp/.h (giwo)
	Created a new class, CJSRuntime to allow multiple runtimes (for threading purposes). (giwo)
	Moved JSObject creation and handling into CJSRuntime. (giwo)
	Moved global JS Context and Runtimes into CJSRuntime. (giwo)
	Moved JS Engine loading code into CJSEngine. (giwo)
	Modified cScript so all JS Scripts on a runtime share a single context. (giwo)
	Removed global.cpp from the project. (giwo)
	Fixed some issues with Multi and Static height calculations. (giwo)
	Moved Definition of global JS classes into CJSRuntime. (giwo)
	Locked the JS Class prototypes for Garbage Collection purposes. (giwo)
	Fixed a crash when shutting down the server. (giwo)
	Updated bitmask setting/getting code for CChar, making it a bit more friendly and less error prone (Maarc)
	Modified OnIterate() to de-allocate any JSObject it uses to free wasted memory. (giwo)
	Merged all boolean values in cServerData to a single UI32 using bitmasking. (giwo)
	Changed the default of totame to 0x7FFF and allowed taming of NPCs with a value of 0. (grimson)
	Changed DFN tags MANA and STAMINA so you can set a minimum and maximum value. (grimson)
	Added new DFN tags: (grimson)
		MANAMAX, STAMINAMAX  They work equal to the HPMAX tag.
		TOPROV, TOPEACE	     They set the minimum skill amount to provocate or peace a NPC.
	Added new JS propertys: (grimson)
		.skillToProv  Can be used to get/set the amount of skill needed to provocate a NPC.
		.skillToPeace Can be used to get/set the amount of skill needed to peace a NPC.
	changed JS propertys: (grimson)
		.maxstamina and . maxmana now work equal to the .maxhp property.
	Added the new JS propertys to the set command. (grimson)
	Fixed a bug that allowed health regeneration while the char was starving. (grimson)
	Moved the bools for the fixed maxHP, maxMana, maxStamina into a bitmask. (grimson)
	Changed CChar::WearItem() to not fire the onEquip event on world loads. (grimson)
	Modified the TOPEACE tag so it can take a second value that sets the chance gain to recover
	from peacemaking upon hits. (grimson)
	Modified cMagic::MagicDamage() and CHandleCombat::HandleCombat() to recover from peacemaking
	by calculating a chance using the chance gain set on TOPEACE and the number of hits. (grimson)
	Added two new JS propertys for chars: (grimson)
		.canAttack  Set this to 0 to prevent a char from attacking.
		.brkPeaceChance  Gets and Sets the chance gain to recover from peacemaking.
	Modified the .skillToProv and .skillToPeace propertys so they return the value of the corresponding
	skill for player chars. (grimson)
	Changed CHandleCombat::HandleNPCSpellAttack() to prevent NPCs from using spells when they
	are not allowed to attack. (grimson)
	Changed cMagic::SelectSpell() to prevent PCs from using spells when they are not allowed
	to attack. Note: This doesn't effect JS implemented spells, use the .canAttack property
	in them to prevent the use of these spells. (grimson)
	Output a sysmessage to PCs informing them that they can not attack. (updated Dictionaries) (grimson)
	Added another new JS property for chars: (grimson)
		.setPeace=#  This handle the whole peacemaking effect, it will stop the char from attacking
			     and prevent him from attacking again until the given time is over or he got
			     enough damage.
	Output a sysmessage to PCs informing them of the end of the peace effect. (Dictionarys again) (grimson)
	Added a line of sight check to the isValidAttackTarget() function in ai.cpp so NPCs won't attack
	targets they can not see. (grimson)
	Modified cCharStuff::addRandomLoot() so that loot lists can contain links to other loot lists. (grimson)
	Added some example usages of ClilocMessage(). (giwo)
	Added support for packet 0xC1, sending cliloc messages. (giwo)
	Added two ClilocMessage() functions, one for direct-to-socket (system) messages, and one
		for object-speech (to a socket or to all sockets in range). (giwo)
	Fixed some areas that could possibly cause MapRegion corruption. (giwo)
	Fixed a VC 2005 Compiler warning. (giwo)
	Defaulted CreateItem() to set decayable to true. (giwo)
	Added functions IsStaticSurface() and IsTileSurface() to mapstuff.cpp and use them in
	CanMonsterMoveHere() to prevent spawnregions from spawning NPCs in places where they
	can not move or shouldn't be able to move to, like display cases. (grimson)
	Updated code that uses |= and &= to use MFLAGSET and MFLAGGET instead, promoting them to a higher public level.  Down to
	 only a very few number of references like that now (Maarc)
	Updated the race code because it was getting out of sync with the WeatherTypes.  The two were bound together in a number
	 of ways, and it's now more generic and tied closer (Maarc)
	Added archery/spell breakage on PC movement.  If a player successfully moves, then the spell they are casting fails,
	 or their archery shoot timer is reset. (Maarc)
	Replaced the WATERCREATURE tag from creatures.npc with a new tag: (grimson)
		MOVEMENT=WATER for creatures that can only move in water.
		MOVEMENT=LAND  for creatures that can only move on land.
		MOVEMENT=BOTH  for creatures that can move on land and in water.
	Added calc_WaterWalk() function to movement.cpp and changed the calc_move() function so that
	it uses it for water creatures and amphibians. (grimson)
	Added IsStaticWet() and CanSeaMonsterMoveHere() functions to mapstuff.cpp. (grimson)
	Added FindCharSpotToSpawn() to cSpawnRegion.cpp and use it when spawning NPCs, renamed
	FindSpotToSpawn() to FindItemSpotToSpawn() and use it when spawning items.(grimson)
	Updated cCharStuff::FindSpotForNPC() to also allow spawning of water and amphibian NPCs. (giwo)
	Modified the JS Object creation to reduce memory waste. (giwo)
	Made some minor modifications to CUSTOMSTRINGTAG and CUSTOMINTTAG handling. (giwo)
	Added some additional debug messages to Region handling. (giwo)
	Fixed a crash involving weather. (giwo)
	Fixed an issue that would cause invalid objects to be left in mapregions. (giwo)
	Fixed some issues caused by my previous changes to objects in mapregions. (giwo)
	Fixed some issues when setting containers. (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing targeting cursors to sometimes target a character when the target should be invalid. (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing JS Gumps not to function. (giwo)
	Added detailed packet logging to CPITargetCursor. (giwo)
	Added two vectors to spawnregions to store valid locations. (grimson)
	You can define valid locations using the new DFN tags:
		VALIDLANDPOS=#,#,#
		VALIDWATERPOS=#,#,#
	Changed FindCharSpotToSpawn() and FindItemSpotToSpawn() so that they first check
	agains the list to see whether a location is valid. If the location is not in the
	list but valid it will be added to the list. If no valid location has been found
	it tries to get a random one from the list of already stored locations. (grimson)
	Added two maps to spawnregions to make checking for valid locations easier. (grimson)
	Check if the z value of stored locations still match the dynamic z value of the
	current locations to track whether dynamics have changed. (grimson)
	It's better to recalculate and check the whole z coordinate of a stored
	location to make shure nothing has changed since we stored it. (grimson)
	Removed the IsSurface check of dynamic tiles from cMapStuff::CanMonsterMoveHere(),
	as many landscape tiles don't have the surface flag set. So it prevented valid spawns. (grimson)
	Added a new ini setting: (grimson)
	COMBATARCHERRANGE=#  This defines the range at which archers stop charging
			     the target in combat. (Default is 7)
	Changed cMovement::SendWalkToPlayer() so that the sequenz number fits the description
	in CPacketReceive.cpp. (grimson)
	Changed CPIResyncReq::Handle() so that it actually does resend everything around
	the player. (grimson)
	Added the Script # to the JS Error Reporter to make debugging easier. (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing JS scripts to give useless error messages on server startup. (giwo)
	Modified the region debug code to not default to on in debug mode. (giwo)
	Updated loading code so that it displays a more accurate percentage during loading (Maarc)
	Minor changes to the JS Handling. (giwo)
	Modified UOXCFile handling to remove all props and added .EOF(), .Pos(), and Length() methods. (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing items not to dissapear when 'removed (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing characters to randomly dissapear around NPC's (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing items and characters to be updated when out of range. (giwo)
	Fixed a VC2005 Compile issue. (giwo)
	Included a default VC 2005 Project/Solution file. (giwo)
	Fixed LineOfSight() not working when you stand directly next to the target. (grimson)
	Changed checkItemLineOfSight() so that it checks whether you can see the base or
	the top of the target item. (grimson)
	Fixed CPIAllNames3D::Handle() so that SHIFT+CTRL actually shows the names of NPCs. (grimson)
	Fixed a possible issue caused by passing float values to JS func RandomNumber() (giwo)

JScript Changes/Fixes:
	Added carpentry, tinker, leather repair, bow repair, bandage, sewing kit, mortar, and archery butte ID's to
	 js_objectassociations.scp (giwo)
	Fixed a bug causing sources for resource-harvesting not to get properly initialized (Xuri)
	Defined respawn delay and maximum resources as easily editable global variables	(Xuri)
	Made items added using 'ADD <hex-id> and 'ADD SPAWNER <hex-id> not decay by default (Xuri)
	Updated creatures.dfn to use the new MOVEMENT tag. (grimson)
	Updated tiles.dfn to set a water tile to wet that was missing that flag. (grimson)
	Fixed a minor issue with axe.js (giwo)
	Updated the peacemaking.js to use the new property and to prevent peacemaking from affecting the
	char using it. (grimson)

DFN Changes/Fixes:
	Fixed a bug with rugs_carpets.dfn where a closing bracket was missing for object 0x1e41	(Maarc)
	Replaced HP tag with HPMAX for all appropriate NPCs (Xuri)
	Updated TOPROV, TOPEACE and TOTAME tags for all NPCs (Xuri)
	Added the HUNGER=#,# description to the header of races.dfn. (grimson)
	Added the TAMEDHUNGER tag to mounts.dfn with a hunger rate of 600 and a chance to become
	 wild of 30%. (grimson)
	Added a new file foodlists.dfn to the items folder containing an example list for horses. (grimson)
	Added the horse foodlist to mounts.dfn. (grimson)
	Added TAMEDHUNGER and FOOD tags to all appropriate NPCs (Xuri)
	Added Squirrel and Ferret NPCs to animals.dfn, and added them to the NPC addmenu (Xuri)
	Fixed a misspelled skillname for a gargoyle NPC (Xuri)
	Added id 0x122a to harditems.dfn with DECAY=1, so blood puddles added when carving corpses actually decay (Xuri)
	Changed animals.dfn, added NPCAI=6 to all animals belonging to the race Predator. (grimson)
	Changed races.dfn, all members of the race Predator change their hunger level every 300 seconds
	 and get damaged for 5 points when starving. (grimson)

-==============================-
-= 20/02/2006 - UOX3 0.98-3.4 =-
-==============================-
Source Changes/Fixes:
	Updated the CPUpdateStat function to use the GetMaxHP, GetMaxStam and GetMaxMana
	 for sending the respective values instead of sending the strenght, dexterity and
	 intelligence values. (Grimson)
	The current HP and (if present) the fixed maxHP will now be saved on worldsaves. (Grimson)
	Added two new DFN tags for NPCs and Items: CUSTOMSTRINGTAG and CUSTOMINTTAG with
	 them you can specify custom tags inside the DFNs and use them in JS scripts. (Grimson)
	Added two new JS functions:
	FindItem( x, y, z, world, id) - returns the item with the "id" that is on the "z"
	 level and closest to the coordinates of x and y. Or NULL if no item is found. (Grimson)
	GetItem( x, y, z, world) - returns the item that is on the given coordinates or NULL if there is no item. (Grimson)
	Fixed an issue causing Large Dragon Ship deeds to not function. (giwo)
	Stopped CChar from saving HP as CBaseObject handles saving hitpoints. (giwo)

	Added an additional option to SKILLPOINT to specify for each level how much skill to gain on success. (giwo)
	Removed EngraveAction() as it did not function and custom skills can be added in JavaScript. (giwo)
	Moved Meditation skill out to JS. (giwo)
	Moved Inscription skill out to JS. (giwo)
	Moved MAKESHOP command out to JS. (giwo)
	Moved Lockpicking skill out to JS. (giwo)
	Moved Skills::TinkerAxle out to JS. (giwo)
	Moved Skills::TinkerAwg out to JS. (giwo)
	Moved Skills::TinkerClock out to JS. (giwo)
	Moved TinkerSextant functionality out to JS. (giwo)
	Made shure to start world timers on server startup. (Grimson)
	Changed startChar() to do a checkRegion() directly after a login. (Grimson)
	Changed CWorldMain::doWorldLight to actually take the current time into account when calculating the light level. (Grimson)
	Added the dungeons to the regions.dfn, so LIGHTDUNGEONLEVEL from the ini is correctly applied to them. (Grimson)
	Removed checkRegion() from startChar() as it isn't needed. (Grimson)
	Fixed the release time check in JailCell::PeriodicCheck(). (Grimson)
	Changed CWorldMain::doWorldLight again, so the light level will actually reach
	 the LIGHTBRIGHTLEVEL and LIGHTDARKLEVEL values. (Grimson)
	Changed the checkRegion() function to prevent useless guard messages when you go from one unguarded region to
	 another unguarded region. (Grimson)
	Changed the getlight command, so it returns the correct value when the region has a weather system. (Grimson)
	Added a rounding function for numbers and use it in the doLight(), command_getlight() and
	 doWorlLight() functions. (Grimson)
	Moved WillResultInCriminal() from combat.cpp to uox3.cpp as it is not limited to combat situations. (Grimson)
	Changed cMagic::MagicDamage() so that attackers can become criminal and murderers. (Grimson)
	Changed CHandleCombat::StartAttack() so that attacking NPCs can become criminal. (Grimson)

	Added Multiple-ID resource handling for create.dfn. (giwo)
	Fixed 3D client crashes with CChar::talkAll() and  CChar::talk(), when the text color is 0x0000 it will
	 be set to the default of 0x5A. (Grimson)
	Changed cMagic::MagicDamage() again, so that the murder count is increased when needed and NPCs fight back
	 when they get attacked with a spell. (Grimson)
	Fixed the text message of the evaluating intelligence skill. (Grimson)
	Removed resource counts before launching create menu's, as the create menu handles that. (giwo)
	Marked StringToNum(), NumToString(), NumToHexString() for later deletion, please use built-in JS
	 method .toString() and function parseInt() in their place. (giwo)
	Implemented JS props .stone and .master for Guilds. (giwo)
	Removed the following JS functions as they are superfluous. (giwo)
		IsRegionGuarded
		CanMarkInRegion
		CanRecallInRegion
		CanGateInRegion
		GetGuildType
		GetGuildName
		SetGuildType
		SetGuildName
		SetGuildMaster
		GetNumGuildMembers
		GetGuildStone
		GetTownMayor
		GetTownRace
		SetTownRace
		GetTownTax
		GetTownTaxResource
		SetTownTax
		SetTownTaxResource
	Committed some fixes to giwo's last commit (missed some changes in cScript.cpp that was blocking people
	 from compiling) (Maarc)
	Removed a lot of commented stuff.  Dead code that's not used any more and things like that have been reduced (Maarc)
	Begun damage/healing tracking support.  All places in C++ code should be covered (will need to update JS engine). Healing
	 and damage is now tracked per character, so that they can find out who has damaged/healed them the most.  If healing/damage
	 hasn't occurred in the past 5 minutes, they get taken off the list (Maarc)
	An offshoot of the damage tracking stuff is a change to combat.  Fame/karma/kills has been moved into CBaseObject,
	 because in future, we'll look at tracking fame/karma/kills updates for weapons and armour (so if you kill repeatedly with a
	 sword, the sword's kill count increases) (Maarc)
	Much of the fame/karma/kills stuff isn't done, and currently, we don't take advantage of the damage tracking. Future
	progressive updates will help with karma/fame parcelling on death, and to help NPCs make smarter decisions in combat

	 it off to other packet handling classes (Maarc)

		STORMDAMAGE - Defines the damage a race takes from storm
		STORMSECS - Defines the interval at which the races takes damage from a storm.

	 It does this by checking whether there is a static or multi above the coordinates. (Grimson)
	Added inBuilding() and SetInBuilding() functions to CChar and set it on movement and teleport. (Grimson)
	Use the new inBuilding() function to stop/start weather effects as soon as a player enters or
	 leaves a building. (Grimson)

	 and doors from outside. (giwo)
	Stopped saving the weather type in regions.wsc, this prevented changes from regions.dfn to apply. (Grimson)
	Make use of the SNOWINTENSITY, RAININTENSITY and STORMINTENSITY from weatherab.dfn, they are now
	 used in calculating the damage a char takes from these elements. The damage is scaled by calculating
	 a random number between 0 and the intensity, this number is then used as a percent value against
	 the damage value in races.dfn. (Grimson)
	Fixed a small bug that prevent a storm from ending. (Grimson)

	Added two new values to weatherab.dfn: (Grimson)
		STORMTEMPDROP this sets the amount the temperature drops when there is a storm

	Renamed HandleWeatherChanges() to CheckCharInsideBuilding() as it is more apropriate. (Grimson)
	Stopped weather effects affecting ghosts of death players. (Grimson)
	Partially rewrote cMovement::SendWalkToOtherPlayers to correctly send chars and remove them from sight. (Grimson)

		sourceObject.CanSee( otherObject );
		sourceObject.CanSee( targX, targY, targZ );
		otherObject can be either a character, item or socket.  If they're not on the same world or the target item is in a container, line of sight fails.
	Proper validation of hair style on creation of elvish characters (Maarc)
	Added new JS event: onCharDoubleClick( pUser, targChar) - allows overriding doubleclicking of characters
	Added new JS event: onSkillGump( socket ) - allows overriding the client's request to open the default skillgump
	Added new JS event: onCombatStart( currChar, targChar ) - allows overriding combat completely
	Added new JS event: onCombatEnd( currChar, targChar ) - allows overriding what happens when combat ends
	JS Event space in cScript expanded from 64 to 96 (Maarc)
	Moved checkkey(), processkey() and cl_getch() from uox3.cpp into CConsole methods (Maarc)
	Added a key/command handler console exposure to the JS environment (involves a secondary runtime because of threading!) (Maarc)
	Note: Creating/editing world objects through this environment is not thread safe, and may cause errors
	Modified Console.PrintDone() and Console.PrintFailed() to take an optional boolean parameter as to whether it is printed instantly, or queued up (Maarc)
	Added functions Console.BeginShutdown() and Console.Reload( intVal ) (Maarc)
		BeginShutdown() takes no parameters
		Reload() takes a single parameter, with the values of
			0	Reload INI
			1	Reload Accounts
			2	Reload Regions
			3	Reload Spawn Regions
			4	Reload Spells
			5	Reload Commands
			6	Reload Definition Files
			7	Reload JS
			8	Reload HTML
	Couple of prettying up with the loading code and what it displays (Maarc)
	Fixed an error with validation of skin and hair colours with human races (my mistake!) (Maarc)
	Fixed a dyed underwear issue with newly created players (Xuri)
	Fixed a bug with clumsy JS (visibility not resetting properly) (Maarc)
	Added JS implementation for heal and feeblemind (Maarc)
	Added JS implementation for magic arrow, but it relies on MagicDamage(), which is not completely implementable (missing Karma, Fame and CPDisplayDamage) (Maarc)
	Added a ValidateObject() function to the JS engine, that behaves the same as it does in the C++ code (Maarc)
	Updated 'set command to support setting of health (via health or hp) (Maarc)
	NOTE: Tweak seems to be broken (the buttons don't fire anything), and I have no idea why (Maarc)
	NOTE: Heal is currently a vampiric heal (some health is subtracted from the caster to heal the target).  This is *not* a new behaviour. (Maarc)
	NOTE: Tweaked up magic arrow damage (a GM mage was doing less than 4 damage every time).   (Maarc)
	Old magic arrow formula
		baseDamage	= 2 + Random( 0, 1 )
		mageryMult	= (Magery / 2000) + 1 (maximum multiplier, 1.5)
		Damage Dealt	= baseDamage * mageryMult - EvalIntCheck
	New magic arrow formula (JS Only!)
		baseDamage	= 2 + Random( 0, 5 )
		mageryMult	= (Magery / 2000) + 1
		DamageDealt	= baseDamage * mageryMult - EvalIntCheck
	The EvalInt check has changed, as well (with the JS code, not the C++ code.  All non-JS spells still adhere to this old standard). (Maarc)
	Previously, a successful check would always draw off a fixed amount of damage ( 10% of your skill level ) (Maarc)
	Adjusted the JS socket property for characters, so that it returns an explicit NULL object if there is no socket attached (Maarc)
	NOTE: Researching into JSExtendedClass instead of JSClass, so that we can implement equality testing (like, attacker != caster sorts of things) (Maarc)
	Hungercheck for players should now be working again (Grimson)
	OnHungerChange JS event will now execute both for hunger level increase as well as decrease, and will also work as global script (Grimson)
	Some fixes for the onHungerChange code to ensure UOX3 doesn't crash when no global script is defined (Grimson)
	Added isAnimal and isHuman as JS character properties. (Maarc)
	Minor code change in tempeffects(). (giwo)
	Updated the version number to reflect recent changes by Maarc and Xuri. (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing JS Skills not to function if a character had a script assigned to him. (giwo)
	Fixed some minor issues with LineOfSight(). (giwo)
	Began to break LineOfSight() into smaller manageable functions. (giwo)
	Renamed SeekMap0() to SeekMap() to better represent it's ability to seek any map file. (giwo)
	More fixes for const correctness. (giwo)
