        WHOLIST

  Purpose: 
        Will display a list of all characters
        currently logged in. Will not display
        characters of disconnected players,
        even if those chars are still ingame.
        This is a GM/Counselor-only command,
        as it allows modifying properties
        of selected characters in the list.
