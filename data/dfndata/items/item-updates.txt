-CARVE_ITEMS.DFN:
	-Rewrote entire file. Removed items that already exist in other DFNs - as we should
	 strive to keep as few duplicate items as possible. Since we're now able to specify
	 the amount of items to add in carve.dfn using ADDITEM=item,amount - we no longer need
	 seperate item-entries for each variation of the amount. To add 10 feathers we now
	 simply use ADDITEM=0x1bd1,10

	 like barbed/spined hides. The item-numbers for carve_items start at [0xC000].

-SHOPLIST.DFN:
	-Added all boat-deeds to the shipwright-shoplist
	-Added jester suit and surcoat to tailor-shoplist
	-Removed blank deeds from provisioner-shoplist

	-Added new itemlists:
		-ITEMLIST 70 - Colored Scales from carve_items.dfn (except blue)
		-ITEMLIST 71 - Black/White Scales from carve_items.dfn
		-ITEMLIST 72 - Vegetables!

-NPCMENUS:
	-Added every single NPC that exists in UOX3's DFNs to the Add-menu

	 This to ensure full compability with filesystems that are case sensitive and/or do not allow/normally use
	 spaces in their file-and folder names.
	-Add Menu rebuilt using the AddMenuCreator tool, touched it up a little afterwards with "previous menu"
	 additions where it was missing, and removed the file extensions (.dfn) from the menu names.

-= ITEM DFN's Updated 2/20/2003 - Zane (giwo) =-
-==============================================-

-Added baseitem.dfn, has a single item in it, base_item which has nothing but empty values.
The idea is all items will (either directly or by calling another item) call it, thus eliminating
the need for empty values.

-Added base_armor.dfn this way basic settings for all armor can be set once, eliminating hundreds of
repetitous entrys in the armor dfns. Each set of colored armor calls the respective base armor item.

-Removed 200+ duplicate items (mostly in the /Building/ directory)

-Fixed some items that had improper ID's

All together, cut the total script size from 2.1megs to 863kb
