This is a complete Regular and T2A set of spawn regions the dungeons for fel( our default world) have the monsters added there is a Sub DIR for Trammel Spawn for when and if you want to add a second World.
the X'Y's are the same for Fel as in Tram so the Jpg works for both sides MAP1.jpg is the map of the Above ground spawnregions if you convert it to a bitmap it will be usable with UOAM (back up the current one in there) 

*Instructions* unzip and put files into your uox3/DFNDATA/spawn dir, restart server and there ya go spawned Dungeons!

**Disclaimer** these arent perfect and i dont pretend that they are if they crash your server( they dont mine) kill your dog or make your spouse leave you I hold no liability**

now that said if you decide to start adding in over land spawn dont spawn the WHOLE world at once as i have not had time to stress test the server to see if it could handle it. Do it a few at a time( but this is just a thought)
