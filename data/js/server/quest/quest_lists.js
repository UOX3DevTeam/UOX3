Hail, and welcome to my humble shop. I am George Hephaestus, New Haven's blacksmith. I assume that you're here to ask me to train you to be an Apprentice Blacksmith. I certainly can do that, but you're going to have to supply your own ingots. You can always buy them at the market, but I highly suggest that you mine your own. That way, any items you sell will be pure profit! So, once you have a supply of ingots, use my forge and anvil to create items. You'll also need a supply of the proper tools, you can use a smith's hammer, a sledgehammer, or tongs. You can either make them yourself if you have the tinkering skill, or buy them from a tinker at the market. Since I'll be around to give you advice, you'll learn faster here than anywhere else. Start off making daggers until you reach 45 blacksmithing skill, then switch to maces until you've achieved 50.

It's a long road to being a Grandmaster Blacksmith, but I have no doubt that if you put your mind to it you'll get there someday. Let me give you one final piece of advice. If you're smithing just to practice and improve your skill, make items that are moderately difficult (60%-80% success chance), and try to stick to ones that use fewer ingots. Now that you're an Apprentice Blacksmith, I have something for you. While you were busy practicing, I was crafting this hammer for you. It's finely balanced and has a bit of magic imbued within that will help you craft better items. However, that magic needs to restore itself over time, so you can only use it so many times per day. I hope you find it useful.",

I am Avicenna, New Haven's resident Healer. A lot of adventurers head out into the wild from here, so I keep rather busy when they come back bruised, bleeding, or worse. I can teach you how to bandage a wound, sure, but it's not a job for the queasy! For some folks, the mere sight of blood is too much for them, but it's something you'll get used to over time. It is one thing to cut open a living thing, but it's quite another to sew it back up and save it from sure death. 'Tis noble work, healing. Best way for you to practice fixing up wounds is to head east out to Old Haven and either practice binding up your own wounds, or practice on someone else. Surely they'll be grateful for the assistance. Make sure to take enough bandages with you! You don't want to run out in the middle of a tough fight.",

It's not much, but it'll help you heal just a little faster, and maybe keep you alive. Good luck out there, friend, and don't forget to help your fellow adventurer whenever possible!",

			"description": "Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Battle spell-casting monsters there until you have raised your Resisting Spells skill to 50. Hail and well met! To become a true master of the arcane art of Magery, I suggest learning the complementary skill known as Resisting Spells. While the name of this skill may suggest that it helps with resisting all spells, this is not the case. This skill helps you lessen the severity of spells that lower your stats or ones that last for a specific duration of time. It does not lessen damage from spells such as Energy Bolt or Flamestrike. The Magery spells that can be resisted are Clumsy, Curse, Feeblemind, Mana Drain, Mana Vampire, Paralyze, Paralyze Field, Poison, Poison Field, and Weaken. The Necromancy spells that can be resisted are Blood Oath, Corpse Skin, Mind Rot, and Pain Spike. At higher ranks, the Resisting Spells skill also benefits you by adding a bonus to your minimum elemental resists. This bonus is only applied after all other resist modifications - such as from equipment - have been calculated. It's also not cumulative. It compares the number of your minimum resists to the calculated value of your modifications and uses the higher of the two values. As you can see, Resisting Spells is a difficult skill to understand, and even more difficult to master. This is because in order to improve it, you will have to put yourself in harm's way - as in the path of one of the above spells. Undead have plagued the town of Old Haven.

I can teach you how to 'Stop the World' around you and focus your inner energies on replenishing your mana. What is mana? Mana is the life force for everyone who practices arcane arts. When a practitioner of magic invokes a spell or scribes a scroll, it consumes mana. Having an abundant supply of mana is vital to excelling as a practitioner of the arcane. Those of us who study the art of Meditation are also known as stoics. The Meditation skill allows stoics to increase the rate at which they regenerate mana. A Stoic needs to perform abilities or cast spells to deplete mana before meditating to replenish it. Meditation can occur passively or actively. Active Meditation is more difficult to master but allows for the stoic to replenish mana at a significantly faster rate. Metal armor interferes with the regenerative properties of Meditation. It is wise to wear leather or cloth protection when meditating. Head east out of town and go to Old Haven. Use spells and abilities to deplete your mana and actively meditate to replenish it.

Remember, you will need blank scrolls as well. Do this until you have raised your Inscription skill to 50. Greetings and welcome to the New Haven Magery Library! You wish to learn how to scribe spell scrolls? You have come to the right place! Inscribed with a steady hand and imbued with the power of reagents, a scroll can mean the difference between life and death in a perilous situation. Those knowledgeable in Inscription can transcribe spells to create useful and valuable magical scrolls. Before you can inscribe a spell, you must first be able to cast the spell without the aid of a scroll. This means that you need the appropriate level of proficiency as a mage, the required mana, and the required reagents. Second, you will need a blank scroll to write on and a scribe's pen. Then, you will need to decide which particular spell you wish to scribe. As with the development of all skills, you need to practice Inscription of lower-level spells before you can move onto the more difficult ones. Inscribing a scroll with a magic spell drains your mana. I suggest you begin scribing any 3rd and 4th circle spells that you know. If you don't possess any, you can always barter with one of the local mage merchants or a fellow adventurer that is a seasoned Scribe.
