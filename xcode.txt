The uox3 xcode projectd is setup for the following directory structure:

UserDirectory(can be anything)
           |
           |
           ----UOX3  (the cloned git repot)
           |
           |
           |--- spidermonkey  (this is a copy of the spidermonkey in the UOX3 repo
           |					that is built for your specific Mac)
           |
           |
           |---uoxdata    << this a directory for your uox data
           			|
           			|
           			|---accounts
           			|
           			|---archives
           			|
           			|---books
           			|
           			|---html
           			|
           			|---jsdata
           			|
           			|---logs
           			|
           			|---msgboards
           			|
           			|---shared
           			
           			
the uox.ini is placed the the UoserDirectory, with the ini file updated.
The uoxdata directories are populated as needed from the repo (like default
acctounts, jsdata/worldtemplates).

This setup allows one to run the source code, without impacting
the repo by the fact uox3 makes/edit data (and that would impact the git)
If you dont use thes setup, the schema needs to be changed (working directory)
entry, and possibly the command line argument.  
If you dont have spidermonkey in this location, then the search paths and library path
in the build settings will need to be changed.
